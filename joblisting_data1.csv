"Build a website to automatically mix & masters songs that people have recorded

","I would like to create something that people can upload their vocals that they
have recorded at home or in a studio to a website that will automatically
transform it to sound mixed & mastered. A website that would be similar to
emastered.com or landr.com but is more complex because they solely focus on
the mastering side of music. I would like to create something that does both
mixing & mastering. AI may be needed to create what I am envisioning. There
will need to be a way to incorporate plugins or at least the things they do to
the audio that I use personally for mixing & mastering in Pro Tools & Logic
Pro onto the website. Pitch correction, equalization, compressors, reverb,
delay, etc. Over the years I have created a vocal template that is universal.
Sounds good on pretty much every person I have ever recorded. But the problem
with this is that I would need to manually download stems that people have
uploaded and input them into my DAW insert my plugins onto the audio channel
and export the project file and upload it back to the website to return it to
the client. I need something that is automatically. like a generator. Analyzes
the audio and manipulates it from the cloud and returns it back to the client
within a minute or less giving them options on how they want it to sound.
People will upload the raw stems of their song. Lead vocals need to be
included and doubles and ad libs are optional. for right now I would just want
to focus on having the beat for the song as one file but all the vocal stems
separate from each other. the websites job is to mix the vocals and give
options for different types of sounds to match the feel of the song. After the
mixing process is done then the song will have to be mastered. Emastered is a
good example because I would like to do a similar way of processing as they
have achieved for their website.

","Hello there! I'm searching for someone who could develop a basic VST plugin
able to go in between different ""snapshots"" of a virtual guitar amplifier.
Essentially, with an existing open source code (it's called NAM - check it
here https://github.com/sdatkinson/neural-amp-modeler ), I can recreate the
sound of a real guitar amplifier in the digital realm, and load this sound as
a preset within a plugin. The issue is that it's just 1 sound \- If I could

different snapshots of this amp at various gain stages, and then the software
would interpolate in between them. Capturing the different gain stages is not
a problem for me, but I lack the technical knowledge to be able to ""blend"" in
between them through code, and ultimately achieving a plugin that allows me to
play with it like if it was a virtual amp knob. Thanks for your time, have a

"Video editing

","Certainly! Here's a more detailed description of the role of a video editor:
As a video editor, your job entails the post-production process of video
creation, where you take raw footage and transform it into a polished final
product. You are responsible for manipulating and rearranging video clips,
applying various effects and enhancements, and ensuring the overall
cohesiveness and quality of the video. One of the primary tasks of a video
editor is editing. Using specialized software and tools such as Adobe Premiere
Pro, Final Cut Pro, or Avid Media Composer, you meticulously organize and
assemble video footage into a coherent sequence. This involves selecting the
best shots, trimming unnecessary content, and arranging the clips to create a
compelling story or message. You have a keen eye for detail and understand the
importance of pacing, timing, and narrative structure. In addition to editing,
you play a crucial role in storytelling. Collaborating closely with directors,
producers, and other members of the creative team, you understand the vision
and objectives of the project. You make creative decisions to ensure that the
story or message is effectively conveyed through the visuals. This includes
determining the sequence of scenes, choosing appropriate transitions, and
creating a consistent mood or atmosphere. Your goal is to engage the audience
and evoke the desired emotional response. Enhancing the video is another key
aspect of your job. You possess expertise in various technical aspects such as
color grading, audio mixing, visual effects, and motion graphics. You have a
deep understanding of software like Adobe After Effects and DaVinci Resolve,
which enable you to manipulate the visual and auditory elements of the
footage. You may adjust the colors and tones to achieve a specific look or
mood, clean up audio tracks, add music or sound effects, and incorporate
visual effects to enhance the visual appeal or create specific visual
illusions. Collaboration is essential as a video editor. You work closely with
other professionals involved in the video production process, including
cinematographers, sound engineers, graphic designers, and animators. Effective
communication and teamwork skills are vital to ensuring that everyone is
aligned with the project's goals and that the final product meets the
expectations of all stakeholders. To excel in your role, you must stay up to
date with the latest trends, techniques, and software in the video editing
industry. You continuously expand your technical skills and experiment with
new tools and features to deliver high-quality results. Additionally, you
possess a strong understanding of video formats, resolutions, codecs, and the
technical requirements for different platforms or distribution channels.
Efficiency and organization are crucial in managing your workload as a video
editor. You often work on multiple projects simultaneously, each with its own
timeline and deadlines. You are adept at managing your time effectively,
prioritizing tasks, and meeting delivery schedules. You also ensure that all
media files are properly organized, stored, and backed up to prevent loss or
data corruption. In conclusion, as a video editor, your role goes beyond mere
technical skills. You are a creative storyteller, a meticulous craftsman, and
a collaborative team member. Your ability to shape and transform raw footage
into a visually compelling and emotionally engaging final product is key to
the success of any video project. Send a message.

","As an AI language model, my primary function is to generate human-like text
based on the inputs and prompts I receive. While I can provide guidance and
suggestions for editing videos, I don't have the capability to directly edit
videos myself. However, I can assist you by offering general tips and
techniques commonly used in video editing. Organization and planning: Before
starting the editing process, it's essential to organize your video assets.
This includes importing all the necessary video clips, audio files, graphics,
and any other media elements into your editing software. Create a clear folder
structure to keep everything organized. Selecting the best takes: Review all
the video footage and identify the best takes or shots for each scene. Look
for good composition, lighting, and performance. Eliminate any unnecessary or
low-quality footage to streamline the editing process. Trimming and arranging
clips: Once you have selected the best takes, trim the clips to remove any
unwanted parts. Arrange the clips in the desired order to create a coherent
and engaging narrative flow. Use transitions between shots to create smooth
and seamless transitions. Audio editing: Pay attention to the audio in your
video. Adjust the volume levels to ensure clarity and remove any background
noise if possible. Consider adding background music or sound effects to
enhance the mood and impact of your video. Color correction and grading:
Adjust the color and tone of your video footage to achieve a consistent and
visually appealing look. Correct any white balance issues and make adjustments
to brightness, contrast, saturation, and other color parameters. Applying a
color grading scheme can help create a specific atmosphere or mood. Text and
graphics: If your video requires text overlays or graphics, add them at
appropriate points in the video. This may include titles, subtitles, lower
thirds, logos, or any other visual elements that support the narrative or
convey information. Transitions and effects: Experiment with different
transitions (such as fades, dissolves, or cuts) to create smooth scene
changes. Use visual effects sparingly and purposefully to enhance the
storytelling or convey a particular message. Final touches: Review the entire
video to ensure it flows smoothly and has a cohesive narrative. Fine-tune the
timing, pacing, and overall editing to create a compelling final product.
Consider adding end screens, credits, or any other elements necessary to
complete your video. Remember, these are just general guidelines, and video
editing is a creative process that allows for personal style and
experimentation. The specific techniques and tools you use may vary depending
on the software you're using and the type of video you're editing.

Youtube gaming channel

","I'm looking to establish a long term relationship with a video editor that I
can trust and help edit my raw twitch gaming clips into funny, humorous
youtube videos. The theme of my youtube channel is on humor and making fun of
myself most times (I'm a terrible player) or just trolling. To get an idea of
the style of content I currently have you can view them on my The Cover Tunes
YouTube channel: https://youtu.be/2bpTroDvzIw https://youtu.be/RqnPyM7bWQk

awesome subtitle effects, cool looking transitions between scenes, effects
like screen shakes and most importantly how you edit funny moments together
... especially if they're gaming related. My channel is about being as funny
so understanding my humor is key. Expected video deliverables are as follows:
\- 5+ min in length \- Usually have about 8-10 min of raw twitch clips I've
already cut from my twitch VODs to use so you don't need to go through hours
of raw footage for that 30 second nugget \- I provide a PDF of the potential
clips and timestamps to use including intro/outro mp4 on dropbox \- Adding in
music/sound effects/subtitles/motion graphics/sound design & mixing when it

"Logo Animator

","Raxxstudios, a production company that specializes in creating high-quality
content for various platforms, is looking for a talented animator to help
create a unique and visually stunning logo for the company. The ideal
candidate should have experience in logo animation and a strong understanding
of motion graphics and design principles. The goal of this project is to
create a logo that embodies Raxxstudios' brand identity and values, while also
being visually appealing and memorable. The logo should be simple, clean, and
easily recognizable, and should communicate the essence of the company's
mission and vision. The animator will work closely with Raxxstudios' creative
team to conceptualize and execute the logo animation. They will be responsible
for developing the animation style, choosing the appropriate typography and
color palette, and incorporating motion graphics techniques that will bring
the logo to life. The ideal candidate should be highly creative, detail-
oriented, and have a passion for animation and design. They should have a
strong portfolio of previous logo animation work and be able to work
collaboratively in a fast-paced, deadline-driven environment. Raxxstudios is
excited to find an animator who can help bring their brand to life through a
stunning logo animation. If you're a talented animator looking for an exciting
opportunity to work with a dynamic production company, we encourage you to
apply! Keep it simple: A clean and simple logo animation can be more impactful
than a complex one. Avoid cluttering your logo with too many elements, and
focus on making it easy to read and understand. Use a consistent color scheme:
Stick to a consistent color palette that represents your brand's personality
and values. This will help create a visual identity that's easily recognizable
and memorable. Pay attention to typography: The font you choose for your logo
can have a big impact on its readability and overall aesthetic. Choose a font
that's easy to read, and experiment with different styles to see what works
best. Play with motion: Animation can help bring A logo to life, so don't be
afraid to experiment with different motion graphics techniques. Consider sound
design: Adding sound effects or music can help make the logo animation more
engaging and memorable. Choose audio that complements your visual design and
creates a cohesive brand experience.

"Active noise cancellation with user-specific voice identification

","Active noise cancellation (ANC) is a technology used in headphones and other
audio devices to cancel out unwanted external noise. It works by using
microphones to pick up external noise and then generating an opposite sound
wave to cancel it out. User-specific voice identification can be used in
conjunction with ANC to create a personalized listening experience. By using
voice recognition technology, the device can identify the user's voice and
adjust the ANC settings accordingly. For example, if the user is in a noisy
environment and wants to listen to music, the device can use ANC to cancel out
the external noise but still allow the user's voice to be heard clearly. This
can be useful for taking phone calls or having conversations without needing
to remove the headphones. Additionally, by identifying the user's voice, the
device can adjust the ANC settings to suit the user's preferences better. For
example, if the user is sensitive to certain frequencies, the device can
adjust the ANC to focus on those frequencies and provide a more effective
noise-canceling experience. Overall, combining ANC with user-specific voice
identification can provide a more personalized and effective listening
experience.

"Video Editor for Cryptocurrency YouTube Channel

","We are looking for an experienced video editor to join our team and help us
create engaging YouTube videos about specific cryptocurrencies. Our videos are
not top 10 videos, but instead focus on explaining the viewer what the crypto
stands for, its potential, recent news around the crypto, and other relevant
information. You need to have Crypto knowledge & you'll be required to find
the best matching footage to the script/voice-over provided. Video's are 8-10
min long. We want 2 new videos a week, with a 72 hour turnaround. We focus on
quality, not quantity. In the future we might need more videos depending on
how your videos perform. We don't like to see: Stock footage - Using stock
footage may lower average view duration by making videos appear generic and
disjointed, leading to viewer disinterest and potential copyright issues.
Creating original and valuable content is crucial for viewer engagement.
However, stock footage can be used strategically by combining multiple clips
and animations to enhance appeal. (For example by combining multiple stock
footage and animations at the same time) Bad communication - Poor
communication between a client and freelancer for YouTube automation can lead
to several negative consequences such as mismatched expectations, missed
deadlines, and frustration for both parties. Clear and frequent communication
is essential to ensure successful collaboration, establish expectations,
clarify requirements, and build trust between the client and freelancer.
Requirements: \- Proven experience as a video editor \- Proficiency in video
editing software, such as Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro \- Knowledge of
cryptocurrency and the ability to explain complex topics in an engaging and
easy-to-understand way \- Strong attention to detail and ability to work
independently \- Excellent communication and collaboration skills \- Review
raw footage to understand the story and message. \- Assemble a rough cut that
communicates the message and flows smoothly. \- Add elements such as
music/visual aids/infographics/animations and sound effects to enhance the
viewer's experience. \- Ensure pacing maintains viewer interest by cutting
extraneous footage. \- Review the final edit for alignment with branding and
technical issues before delivery. Here are some visual elements that could
inspire your creative mind for an engaging YouTube video about a specific
cryptocurrency: Historical footage of the cryptocurrency - Including footage
of the cryptocurrency's history, including its early days and evolution over
time, can help to give viewers a better understanding of the cryptocurrency's
development and context. Demonstrations of how to use the cryptocurrency - If
the cryptocurrency has a specific use case or function, including footage of
how to use it can help to provide practical insights and guidance to viewers.
Footage of crypto exchanges - If the cryptocurrency can be bought or sold on a
specific exchange, including footage of the exchange and how it works can help
to provide valuable information to viewers. Footage of cryptocurrency wallets
- Including footage of different types of cryptocurrency wallets, such as
software or hardware wallets, can help to educate viewers on how to store and
protect their cryptocurrency. Footage of the blockchain - Including footage of
the blockchain, such as how it works and how transactions are processed, can
help to provide viewers with a better understanding of the underlying
technology behind cryptocurrencies. Animations or motion graphics -
Incorporating animations or motion graphics can help to add a dynamic and
visually appealing element to the video, while also simplifying complex
concepts and information. Cryptocurrency influencers or thought leaders -
Including footage of influencers or thought leaders in the cryptocurrency
space, such as YouTubers, bloggers, or experts in the industry, can help to
provide viewers with valuable insights and perspectives on the topic. By
incorporating these additional footage ideas into the videos you will be
creating, you can create even more engaging and informative content that
effectively communicates the desired message to the viewer and sets your
created videos apart from the competition. If you read till this part and
apply: make sure to say ""One of a few"" Your Job - Take care of the Video and
visuals part. You need to make sure people, places and things that are
mentioned are actually shown in the video, with full High definition footage.
If there really is ZERO footage available, and you as the editor have no other
inspiration, ONLY then you are allowed to use stock footage (In combination
with effects/other stock footage) We are paying $30 per video. Upon your
application, we will send you a 1 minute script. We require you to create a 1
minute snippet. We will select the one with the best turnaround, previous
feedback and your portfolio of work. PS. We have lower thirds, transitions,
effects etc etc

"Need Experienced Sound Designer to Create Realistic Weapon Related Sounds For
FPS Game

","Price is a placeholder. Hi, I am looking for an experienced sounds designer /
producer etc... To create a bunch of sound effects for my weapons. The sounds
need to be realistic and detailed, but also very powerful, punchy, and
crunchy. The perfect reference for how I want the sounds to sound like would
be the MW 2019 / 2022 games. Here is a video of the weapon showcases for
reference: (link removed) The weapons that I am in need of range from actual
guns (pistols, snipers, shotguns etc...) to grenades (explosions, debris
explosions, the sounds the grenade would make), as well as miscellaneous sound
and more. The different weapon types would of course need different sets of
weapons, but a good general list of what I need for each weapon sound set is
as written below: ** I would like versions for some of these to have a version
of military clothy foley and no foley, this would depend on what the character
wears in game for clothing) 1\. Fire (5-6 variants similar sounding but not
exactly the same for a bit of shooting variety) 2\. Suppressed Fire (5-6
variants similar sounding but not exactly the same for a bit of shooting
variety) 3\. Bolt action (Twisting the bolt, pulling it back, pushing it
forward, and twisting back down) 4\. Mag Action (taking out the mag, putting
the mag back in) 5\. Draw (Weapon and clothing Foley) 6\. Holster (Weapon and
clothing Foley) 7\. Select Fire switch 8\. Weapon melee (the weapons can be
used as melee so this sound would be the best if your ability to swing and
move the gun as if your hitting someone with it, the swing sounds like wooshes
can be reused from gun to gun if it makes sense but the actual weapon sounds
made during that of course are unique to that weapon) 9\. Miscellaneous weapon
touching and moving (this is very hard to describe, but some of the
animations, such as weapon inspect, involve the weapon being moved around
while being gripped, or being touched, caressed, randomly moving around, etc.
So basically just a bunch of random handling sounds of the actual weapon that
do not involve any of the weapon mechanics such as the magazine, or the
slide/bolt) an example of this as well could be when aiming down the sights
and un aiming, or weapon holstering or drawing the weapon) 10\. Movement
based( similar to miscellaneous, these are sounds that the gun will make when
you’re handling it while moving. So walking, running, Crouch, walking,
crawling, diving etc…) 11\. Weapon Drop- this would be like the sound of the
gun falling down and hitting a surface. Obviously, I don’t expect you to drop
your weapons on hard surfaces, but if you have an idea as to how maybe you
could do that, that would be great. And then we could add other layers to the
sound so that we could have different surfaces. For things like grenades and
explosions of course some of these can be replaced. Ex: 11. Weapon Drop where
the weapon falls to the ground, can be replaced for grenades with a grenade
bounce and roll for different surfaces, so these are interchangeable based on
weapon types. Note: For some sounds that may be very similar from gun to gun
can be reused for other weapon sets of course for a reduced cost. Ex: If the
weapon movement and Miscellaneous weapon touching and moving would be
extremely similar for two pistols or more, than we don't need to recreate them
for a new pistol that sounds the same. I am ok if real-world samples from
professionally recorded studios are used, but they still need to be worked on
to fit what it is that I need as a final result, but anything custom or custom
recordings if you personally can do that would be great too. If you have no
samples I may be able to provide a couple of samples I have from my libraries
and hopefully, this can reduce pricing as well. Lastly, if possible Id like
when all the sounds have been made, I can send video of some of animations of
that weapon and then the sounds can be put together to properly create the
action sound. Hopefully this can be done as a bonus as it is a more simple
part but that would be great. It is important to note that I do have many many
weapons to do around 60-70 to do for now, so any bulk price discount would be
great! If anyone is interested I am looking forward to the discussion!

"Buying Dreamlike/Ominous/Atmospheric Music for Short Film (Reference: Lynch
and Eggers)

","Hello! I’m a film director currently working on a very low budget film which
is a personal project of mine. As such, I’m looking for music which I can use
in it (which is licensed). ABOUT THE SHORT FILM It’s a story about dealing
with loss. One night, Guilherme is having a nightmare and his recently dead
mother “pays him a visit” to confort him one last time. Guilherme wakes up and
his mother is gone. At first, he feels scared, but slowly he starts to realize
what happened and whishes “her spirit” was still there. Guilherme is alone.
MUSIC I’m looking for music that’s both unsettling and leaves the viewer
feeling uncomfortable while the “haunting sequence” is happening. At the same
time, I’m looking for something almost heavenly and spiritual for the ending.
The entire short film is very dreamlike, and I want the music to be as well.
My main reference is Angelo Badalamenti’s work with David Lynch, mainly in
Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me and Mulholland Drive. WHAT I NEED FROM YOU
Unfortunately, I’m not looking for someone to compose. Usually, I’d have
someone compose the music for the film, but due to the nature of the project I
need music that’s already done. The film is entering a low budget competition
and it needs to be completed by the end of the week. If you have one or more
tracks which you think fit the mood I’m looking for, please let me know your
price for them. I’ll also need a license to have everything in order. If you
could show me a version of the song with and audio watermark it would be
perfect. I’ll also need the license as soon as I buy the music. I’m leaving
the link for my website in case you’d like to see some of my previous work:

"Modern (Tech/UK House) Ghost Production

","Hi there, I am an up and coming electronic music producer based in New
Zealand. My style is modern house inspired by the UK Fred Again style sound \-
I make house and also garage. I make music that you can dance/2 step to but
that also has depth and melodic + vocal aspects (music for everyone!). I have
been producing for about 2.5 years now and am trying to hone my production
skills to be able to release a huge single on a large record label this year.
However in order to cut my learning curve down slightly I am reaching out to
experienced producers to see if they could ghost produce a tech house piano
track in the style of the reference tracks attached? Please let me know how
this process works for you and whether you can send me exports along the way
so that we are both on the same page and know how the output product will turn
out. Do you also have a portfolio of other tracks you have produced in the
past so I can see what other stuff you have made? Maybe we could jump on a
zoom call to discuss next steps. I am also currently making 20 tracks in 20
days and documenting the process on social media (@tomnewman.music) - to give
you an idea on some of the sounds I am workign with at the moment. Thanks for
your time on this, Cheers

go through-OAR song 3- sad fiddle music with strong angry bass song
4-something very similar to the song heavy eyes by Zach Bryan song 5- I would
like movie samples before the beat starts and right when the beat ends, beat
should be a powerful folk beat with a beat that would be good for subwoofers.
song 6-similar to the song Birmingham by Zach Bryan and running gun by Marty
Robbins song 7- civil war style folk song with modern twist (incorporate the
idea of the American civil war either through vocal samples or instruments)
song 8- upbeat mandolin story telling vibe song 9-similar to quitting time by
Zach Bryan song 10-very energetic makes the listener feel like they are
arriving at a friends house for a party. maybe something kind of similar to
the song what was I thinkin by Dirks Bentley please keep in mind I would like
to add vocals to these beats, however none of the lyrics have a chorus so I
would like a steady flowing beat. I will send you the lyrics prior to the

long in total. We are currently in post-production. \- My goal is to have this
video published on YouTube on July 7, 2023. \- I am looking to start the music
composition process as soon as June 1, 2023. However, I am flexible to
whatever timeline is best for the hired composer. What I am looking for \- I
am looking for a cinematic/orchestral sound for the content. \- If music
software is used for the instruments, I would like the instruments to sound as
life-like as possible. \- I am looking to also have a cover of the folk song
Tanabata no Uta for the credits. The idea I have is a male and female part
singing the song as if the two lovers from the legend are singing to each
other. I would love to have singers that sing in fluent Japanese if possible.

receive and believe are fair. \- I will provide credits to the composer in the
video and the video description according to the music composer's wishes. If
you have any questions or if there is anything else I can provide that would

"Audio mixing

","I can mix audio. Understanding Sound As an audio mixer, it is essential that
you have a good understanding of sound. This includes understanding how sound
travels, how it is captured, and how it is perceived by the human ear. You
should be able to differentiate between different types of sound such as
dialogue, music, sound effects, and background noise. Technical Skills In
addition to having a good understanding of sound, you need to have technical
skills to operate the equipment required to mix audio. You should have a good
understanding of audio hardware such as mixing consoles, microphones, and
amplifiers, as well as software such as digital audio workstations (DAWs) and
plugins. You should also be proficient in audio editing, noise reduction,
equalization, compression, and other audio processing techniques.
Communication Skills As an audio mixer, you will often work with a team of
people, including directors, producers, sound designers, and other audio
professionals. Effective communication is crucial to ensure that the final
audio product meets everyone's expectations. You need to be able to understand
the vision of the project and communicate your ideas and suggestions clearly.
Creative Skills As an audio mixer, you need to have creative skills to enhance
the audio elements of a project. You need to be able to add subtle nuances to
the sound to create a specific atmosphere, emotion or mood. For example, you
may need to add background music to a scene to create tension or suspense or
use sound effects to make a scene more realistic. Organization Skills Audio
mixing involves working with a large number of audio files and tracks. You
need to be organized to keep track of the various audio elements and ensure
that everything is in its place. This includes naming tracks and files
appropriately, creating backups, and organizing audio files in a logical
manner. Time Management As an audio mixer, you will often work under tight
deadlines. You need to be able to manage your time effectively to ensure that
the project is completed on time. This may involve working long hours,
prioritizing tasks, and delegating work to other team members. Attention to
Detail Audio mixing involves paying close attention to detail. You need to be

","Hello, I have a song from a movie that needs to be cleaned up from dialog and

environment. To ensure success and avoid misunderstandings, we would like to
highlight a few issues we have encountered in the past with previous
collaborators. By learning from these experiences, we hope to create a more
seamless workflow and produce exceptional content together. Highlight
Selection: In previous projects, some editors chose average plays as
highlights, such as players merely running down the field. When selecting
highlights, focus on moments that truly stand out, such as goals, big saves,
clean hits, good stick checks, and celebrations. Our Team Focus: We have
experienced instances where editors created highlights for the wrong team.
Please pay close attention to the specific team we are focusing on in each
project, as this is crucial for maintaining consistency and relevance in our
content. Audio Selection: Some editors have not used trendy sounds from
Instagram or TikTok. While it is not mandatory, incorporating popular sounds
can enhance the appeal of our content. If you cannot find a suitable trendy
sound, don't worry! We can help by adding an appropriate audio track from
TikTok or Instagram. Speed Ramps: In the past, some editors have struggled
with using speed ramps effectively. Please ensure you apply speed ramps at the
right moments, such as during a juke, a shot load-up, or when the ball hits
the net. Skillful use of speed ramps can significantly elevate the overall
impact and excitement of our videos. By addressing these past experiences, we
aim to set clear expectations and guidelines for our collaboration. We are
confident that, together, we can create engaging and high-quality sports
content that will captivate our audience on TikTok and Instagram Reels.

"Video Editor for Tech-Focused YouTube Channel

","**About the Channel:** Hi there! My name is Marco, and I'm starting a YouTube
channel focused on AI tools, SaaS, and other tech to help business owners,
solopreneurs, and busy parents be more productive. I plan on making 1-2 videos
per week, typically around 5-15 minutes long, and I'm in search of a talented
video editor to join me on this journey. **The Opportunity:** I'm looking for
a video editor to work with me on a long-term basis. While I have some
preferences in terms of editing style, I'm open to collaborating with you and
incorporating your creative ideas as we develop the channel together.
Initially, we'll start with a trial task to see how well we work together.
**Requirements:** \- Experience with video editing software, preferably Final
Cut Pro X (as that's what I've been using), which allows me to make final
adjustments to the project before exporting. \- Proficiency in English
language. \- Good understanding of pacing, storytelling, and viewer engagement
in videos. \- Ability to incorporate music, sound effects, and captions to
enhance the story. \- Experience with creating hooks to capture audience
attention and maintain interest throughout the video. **What I'm Looking
For:** \- Good use of music to complement the story (access to our accounts at
https://app.personamusic.io/artist/143 or https://audiio.com/browse). \- Sound
effects to help tell the story. \- Captions in crucial moments, similar to the
style of Mr. Beast: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/FD-0KG-h2-c. \- Movement
(slow zoom in, zoom out) and potential for dual camera shooting in the future.
\- A lot of b-roll. \- Hooks that may include rapid clip switching or other
techniques to capture the audience's attention. **Example of how to implement
Desired Editing Style:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akNsyafEAMQ Please
note that while I appreciate Mr. Beast's editing style, my content and target
audience differ from his. My channel is geared towards a more professional,
slower-paced audience. **To Apply:** If you're interested in this opportunity
and believe you're the right fit, please submit your application in English,
along with any relevant work samples or a portfolio showcasing your video
editing skills. I look forward to hearing from you!

impression it’s different shots \- the added shakiness of some shots to
emphasise the music you hear \- the slow zoom effect to always have some
movement even if it’s filmed on a fixed camera \- the music being played live
is synced perfectly to the the beat you’re hearing I will shoot everything
vertically on my Sony FX3 camera in S-log with an Aputure LS600x as my main

you will need to color grade the footage. We will find out the right

","Hey all 👏 It's that time when I am getting more work requests than I can chew
myself and would like to grow my brand into a small audio team that is capable
of bringing awesome sound to bigger and more frequent projects! I am already
working with a composer for the last 2 years, hence this job post is ONLY FOR
SOUND DESIGN. If you also make music, that's great and might be an asset but
won't be important during the hiring stage. Please do NOT send any of your
composition reels, or Soundcloud profiles. Examples of projects: \- game audio
asset design \- implementation in the engine (rare) \- post-production sound
design, foley, mix (infographics, film, ads) \- ambience and soundscapes
design \- audiobook editing \- audio editing of all sorts \- audio repair and
clean-up (voice-over for example) Suggested workflow: 1\. You would receive a
project proposal for your time/cost estimation (this includes all necessary
materials, references etc) and I would like you to get back to me to
coordinate the project with the client. 2\. Client accepts the estimation or
we continue the talk until we find a mutual agreement. 3\. You deliver the
project as expected and agreed upon. 4\. Project gets reviewed by me and the
client, which could require revisions. 5\. After everyone is happy with the
quality, the project is finalized and you get paid for the agreed total. Few
notes: \- I get a lot of requests, but naturally, they don't mean guaranteed
work. After the client receives a full breakdown and a quote from us, they can
consider it as not fit or too expensive - know how to estimate projects
quickly and be aware that many quotes might be turned down. \- You get to
choose your revision policy. Flat total and x amount of revisions included or
extra charge for each revision after x. Your call :) \- I am only starting to
grow into the team, although I have years of experience working with dev teams
as well as other audio professionals. Once we establish a good workflow and I
will be able to accept more simultaneous projects, another person will be
brought into the team, as well as an update to the website to include all
members 🎉 Requirements: \- portfolio to demonstrate the quality of work -
SOUND DESIGN ONLY \- access to SFX libraries/instruments/plugins to take on
the majority of projects \- communicative English \- availability during the
week to reply to requests \- attention to detail and delivering projects you
can be proud of Not required but favourable: \- being a Reaper user \-
knowledge of UE4, Unity, Wwise or FMOD \- knowledge of iZotope RX/Audition \-
music composition skills or at least some basic jingles/melodies This is a
great opportunity if you are an entry-level audio professional who is looking
for more traffic and exposure to projects 🙌 If you are interested in this

yourself! A bit about me: I am a UK-based freelance sound designer working on

speakers but I’m pretty sure everyone wants that. Step by Step Brief for 10
Tracks 1) I really suck at song structure and haven’t paid much attention to
it. If there are major errors in where the chorus or verse or intro or outro
should enter/exit, please correct them. If it’s a smaller thing and you’re not
sure if I meant it or it’s an error, please feel free to ask (I could be
experimenting sometimes). 2) Remove or replace 1 instrument for any reason you
see fit. For example if there’s a stem where the quality is not good enough or
if there’s an instrument that’s really taking you out of the song. 3) Add
between 1 and 3 instruments to elevate the song around the second verse and
second chorus. If you need to temporarily add or remove sequences here to
improve the drama of the song that would be fine. I’m trying to get the tracks
more dynamic in their progression. I like high-highs and low-lows. 4) Pre-
Vocals Mix and Master: I need a version of the track that I can market to
vocalists. If you have any recommendations or connections with young emerging
artists please let me know. 5) [To Be Charged/Paid After Agreeing Each Artist]
Arrange 1 vocalist per track to write and perform the song. I will Direct the
subject of the writing and approve the final writing with a maximum 2 rounds
of revision per track. For writing, I lean very heavily towards Kendrick Lamar
and Kanye West. For some flavor I’m loving what I’m hearing from Latin Hip Hop
and Afropop these days. I like people who share radical things about the world
or about their spiritual journey or have a great sense of humor/fun.
Definitely people who sound unique is best. I’m happy to work with a vocalist
from any of these languages: English, Arabic, Spanish, Nigerian Pidgin,
Jamaican accent, Hindi/Urdu, Russian, Portuguese, Mandarin, Japanese. Want to
have 50% female vocals. If we do not find or agree on an artist, I will ask
you to deliver the final mixed and mastered track without vocals. 6) Post-
Vocals Mix and Master + Final Touches. 7) Deliver 10 tracks mixed and mastered
in lossless format.

"Help make a musical score for my sci-fi/fantasy universe

","1.The Project: Hello! So I need to create a score for my sci-fi/fantasy
universe. I'm thinking something that mixes fantasy crpg type music with
something industrial/bleak. For examples, think of ""Baldur's gate 3"" opening
score, ""Divinity Original sin 2"", and ""neverwinter nights"" soundtracks. And
mix that with something like Blade runner 2 (film score) or even the
terminator. But really just something epic. The scope for this first project
is really to get my feet wet and to decide who fits the role. 2\. Where will
it be used? Well, any promo that I do for my written works and also lore video
series for my youtube channel. I have a few examples up already here:
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCfLbdL8NPB7ewNXrY3q_ow There you will see I
have an unfinished lore video and CH.1-3 audiobook of my novella ""Dawn's
Call."" So you could imagine I could have a good catchy soundtrack to open the
videos, or to play along as the V.O. goes through the content. If everything
works out - I'll also make sure and add your name to the credits. 3\. Will
there be more work? Possibly. I think getting the opening score down will open
the door to other soundtracks. I really dig how in some films, each character
has their own version of the score (think star wars and LOTR.) But as this is
a universe and story building project - it's going to take a while to have
everything down. 4\. Who Am I? My name's J.L. Lockwood, I'm a visual artist
and creative director for a medical animation studio. I've been in the
creative industry for about 13 years and am trying to bring to life ideas I've
had since the late 90's. https://www.jllockwood.art 5\. Have any examples?
Yes, so I have a composition I created in fruity loops - but alas, I'm not a
professional musician, I think I want the score to have this general feel, and
melody etc. But I'd love to just punch it up and make it sound professional.
(I will attach the clip below) Notice that it it is loopable, (ends where it
begins.) 6\. What's your budget? I have a moderately sized budget, but since
I'm just an individual here, I'd like to keep it reasonable. And since this is
a pilot to really test where the artist will take this concept, I must be a
bit frugal right now - but if I'm loving the work, I'll do what I can to get
you compensated with more work down the line!

[10 stereo tracks] \- ambiences [10 stereo tracks] We need a 'quick and dirty'
mix and master optimized for virtual web screenings. This version is NOT going
to festivals, cinema, VOD or streaming platforms. It will be only for private
virtual screenings and maybe screenings at a conference. All we need for now
is a mixdown and master split into stems as usual, so we have more editing
freedom when creating audience specific cuts. We'll have a second round for
the full final mix once we create the directors cut. You can read more about
our film on https://theheartrevolution.org/documentary The length will be
approx. 1 hour 45 min. We'll have our final cut with all sound prepared in
mid/late October 2023. Please send me your Imdb page or website with films you
worked on. What will it cost? How much time do you need? Looking forward to
hearing from you. Please begin your response with ""Sounds interesting.""
Warmly, Benedikt

"Seeking Creative Music Producer for Original Instrumental Tracks (no samples)

","Hello/Hola! I have a personal project that I'm developing that will help
children/young adults learn English or Spanish, technology, music and more.
I'm looking for a producer or beat maker who can provide me with short 2min
instrumental tracks and they must be copyright free. These will be used with
some simple animation that is being created to make the videos more engaging
or to have as options for the students to use inside the platform, etc.
Looking for: 5 instrumental tracks to start with (with the possibility of
hiring you to work every month creating more.) * No samples (like unchanged
splice loops, arcade, other royalty free samples or remixing of songs that
already exist. One shots are ok. Please ask me if there’s anything you’re not
sure if you can use or not) - I have a software that will tell me if they
infringe any copyrights, I’m very serious about all music-copyright issues,
don’t want anyone to get into any trouble in the future * Unreleased tracks
that you represent 100%, no collabs * Songs that haven’t been registered,
shared, licensed, uploaded anywhere Genres that I’m looking for are Lofi
(think study music, chill background music, chillhop), Hip Hop (this one is
for young adults, think driving hook-oriented, intense), and Pop (but not
Disney kids pop, more like cool pop, contemporary and modern, not childish at
all. If you are a piano player, I also need some solo piano tracks (relaxing
and soft, peaceful and calming) for some of the repetition language activity /
gamified learning sections of the platform. What I’m NOT looking for: * 4 bars
that repeat over and over again for 2 minutes. Dynamics when needed, sections,
different hooks/melody lines, patterns. BUT keep it simple, it’s not supposed
to be a busy beat. You don’t need a ton of instruments or tracks but layers
are good. * No cheap sounding instruments. This doesn’t mean you can’t use the
sounds that come for free in your DAW, those are great if you treat them, EQ,
give them cool effects and layers, etc. Do your thing! *No demo sounding
tracks. Looking for finished mixed tracks (hopefully you already have a
template and mix chain that you can easily throw on the track.) *Complicated
or busy tracks. It is ok if these are tracks that you created in the past and
have just laying around in your drive not doing anything with. Make sure
they’ve never been released, uploaded or signed anywhere. This is perfect if
you like creating beats already for fun and are looking to sell them. Please
send a link where I can hear examples of your work and tell me which DAW you
use. Hablo español.

audio in the 2 person interview. Offering $85 per project. I'm open to
alternative ideas of how to produce these episodes to make the workflow easier
on you. Provide examples of similar work you've performed and the rates you
earned for them, and I'll be open to reconsidering these figures. New to

"I need a long-term editor for my YouTube videos

","Hey, I'm looking for an experienced video editor to help create 1 video per
week for my productivity YouTube channel
(https://www.youtube.com/@heyjoeyjustice) With your help, I can focus more of
my time on filming the most best productivity content possible. This will be a
part-time role, and I am looking to build a very personal and long-term
relationship! It's an ASAP start but I am prepared to wait for the right
editor. My video editing inspirations include: Thomas Frank
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNUPmmc5b3c) Ali Abdaal
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5y69v1RbU0&t=5s) As we work together, I will
develop a “mood board” of things I see other creators doing that I would like
us to use for my videos. Here are some more details about the role: I will
provide you with: \- 4K video footage \- A-roll \- B-roll (I usually provide
this after the first round of feedback) \- Handwritten sketches on a white
background if necessary i.e. for an explainer video. \- Processed audio file.
\- Storyblocks login for copyright free B-roll clips, audio and sound effects.
\- Any LUTs I use. \- Any Video Plugins I use for motion tracking, titles and
lower thirds. What I expect in the finished piece: \- Tight and well edited
A-roll. \- Lots of B-roll. \- Titles \- Transitions \- Zooms and cuts \-
Handwritten sketches color keyed. \- Pop-up text, images or icons where
relevant and motion tracked where suitable. \- Intro shot with icons to show
the viewer a high-level timestamp view of what my video will cover. \- Chapter
markers as lower thirds \- Music \- Lots of subtle sound effects \- Up to 2
rounds of feedback as and when necessary. Editing principles I live by: \-
Front load your best and most creative editing into the first 30-60 seconds.
It's the sacred period of time where a viewer decides to click off or invest
in full-screening the video. \- The 10 second rule. Generally speaking,
*something* should be happening on the screen every 10 seconds. Novelty keeps
viewers engaged. \- The 30 second rule. B-roll every 30 seconds. \- Extremely
tight A-roll edit, i.e. no umms, ahhs or unnecessary pauses particularly at
the start and edit of clips. \- Use different types of cuts to keep viewers
engaged - I recently started using J-cuts, and I'd love to see soft zooms or
zoom cuts in future videos. \- Subtle sound effect overlays add up to create
an awesome experience. Use as many as you can to enhance what's happening on
screen \- e.g. I talk about using Apple Watch to pay for groceries and the
Apple Pay sound effect plays in the background. My preferences for applicants:
\- Can provide 1 video per week, with an average runtime of 15 minutes. \- Use
of Adobe Premier Pro would be great as it allows me to make final touches. \-
Frame.io for fast and detailed feedback. \- A turnaround time of 4 days or
less. \- English proficiency and communication. \- A timezone close to New
York, USA (EDT) \- Knowledge of YouTube (thumbnails, retention strategies)
highly preferred If this sounds like you, please respond with: \- Name of the
video editing software you use and current computer setup. \- Tools you're
familiar with for song selection, managing files, receiving feedback etc. \-
Links to 1 or 2 previous videos you're most proud of editing. \- Link to one
of your favorite YT creators. If you have any questions, please let me know.
Look forward to hearing from you!
