Alex M.,Toronto,Mixing &amp; Mastering Engineer | Professional Podcast Editor,"I&#039;m taking your records to the HIGHEST industry standards üîâüèÜüîâ. The music field is very competitive, and TOP-QUALITY sound is the ultimate goal for every artist, songwriter, or band. 

Common problems I hear when music producers try to mix and master themselves:

üîá Your track doesn‚Äôt translate well on a variety of audio systems. There is a simple reason for this;
üîá There is no depth. Tons of reverb and delays but the sound is still tiny and washy;
üîá Total mess in the low end. Kick and Sub compete with each other. I know you think about eq, sidechain, and filters. Stop! Don‚Äôt let them destroy everything;
üîá Dull Vocals. You have used all possible effects, but it is still dull. There is a solution;
üîá Overcompressed sound. That‚Äôs a common problem for somebody who wants to get a loud track but ends up with an overcompressed and weak sound;
üîá Misconception of loudness. How loud should I master my songs? Streaming services have their own rules, but big artists do not care. ü§î

I can continue the list, but I‚Äôm here to solve these problems. Let professionals do their job and you will be surprised. üíé

My Sevices:

‚úÖ Single/Album Mixing;
‚úÖ Single/Album Mastering;
‚úÖ Additional Production (if needed): Sound Design, Sample Replacement, Arrangement Development;
‚úÖ Manual Vocal Tuning/Pitch Correction;
‚úÖ Audio Editing/Cleaning.

Crucial Steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Contact me via Upwork. I always respond within 24 hours (even if I am overloaded with work);
2Ô∏è‚É£ Send me your demo (raw version of your track), and I will listen and let you know about specific details;
3Ô∏è‚É£ Send me your multitrack. Format: Wav 44.1khz/24bit (at least). Make sure that all tracks begin from a zero point;
4Ô∏è‚É£ I will estimate the price and time individually for your project;
5Ô∏è‚É£ We agree on terms and I start to work on your project.

Deliveries:

‚úÖ 44.1khz/24bit wav files. This is a common format for digital distribution on streaming platforms.
‚úÖ DDP format of your album. DDP is commonly used for the delivery of disc pre-masters for duplication.
‚úÖ Mp3 or AAC for your own use.  

Have any questions or audio issues? Want to discuss your projects?
Let me know, and I&#039;ll be glad to help you.

Micah K.,New York City,"Music Producer, Mix Engineer and Audio Mastering Specialist.","I&#039;m a producer, mix engineer, mastering engineer, and recording engineer with past clients such as: 
- Republic Records
- Aaron Hagan (Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez, Meghan Trainor)
- Andy Cardenas (Madonna, Boys II Men, Lil Kim)
- Carl Sturken (Rihanna, Kelly Clarkson) 
- CBS
- Jack Payne (over 2 million plays) 

I also hold a Master&#039;s degree in Music Technology from NYU. I&#039;ve worked across practically every genre on hip-hop, pop, RnB, jazz, and full orchestras recorded for playback in surround sound and Dolby Atmos. 

I&#039;m experienced in Pro Tools, Logic Pro, and Ableton Live. I&#039;m able to provide guidance on how to properly license your songs, protect your copyrights, and ensure that you&#039;re collecting the revenue that you&#039;re entitled to.  

Beneath you&#039;ll find some testimonials from past clients.

‚úì ‚ÄúThe vocal sounds like a much higher price mic was used. It‚Äôs kind of amazing how you got this to sound. Right off the bat, it is SOOOOO appealing. You do first-rate work!‚Äù 

- Aaron Hagan (Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez)

- Audio Mastering:
Using a combination of analog and digital gear, I have a history of success mastering pop, hip-hop, orchestral works, and podcasts. Whether you&#039;re looking for a subtle shaping or an aggressive radio-ready record, I have the experience to make your audio shine.

‚úì ‚ÄúBest communication I‚Äôve had with an engineer, plus amazing work. This dude really delivers, and is versatile, being able to handle many different genres.‚Äù

- Music Production:
As a producer, my skills as a pianist/guitarist, audio engineer, music composer, and artistic director come together so that I can facilitate your art reaching its highest potential both creatively and professionally. 

‚úì ‚ÄúMicah absolutely blew me away on this project. High levels musicianship, professionalism, industry insight, and technical expertise like this rarely co-exist. Would definitely hire again‚Äù 

- Music Mixing:
A great mix can make or break a record, no question about it. For me, mixing is about more than &quot;getting a good balance&quot;, it&#039;s about creating the world the artist envisions. 

‚úì &quot;Micah, you completely brought this project to life, it&#039;s exactly what I imagined. I swear you&#039;re equal parts, mind reader and audio engineer.&quot;

- Audio Restoration:
I&#039;m highly experienced using spectral editing for the removal of room noise, harsh ‚Äús/t/k‚Äù sounds, pops, clicks, and even dogs barking in the background. If it can be saved, I can save it. 

‚úì &quot;I&#039;m so happy we worked together. This performance was a once in a lifetime event, and you breathed a new life into the recording&quot;

- Vocal Tuning and Alignment: 
I tune vocals by hand to provide much more transparent results than AutoTune or even Melodyne. I also align vocals to create tight doubles and harmonies, providing a larger sounding, cleaner sound. 

The testimonial for this service is from a really talented UK artist and it&#039;s probably my favorite review...

‚úì&quot;No joke, this pitch cleanup is so hard to detect it&#039;s scary.&quot; 

Some of my expertise includes Pro Tools, Logic Pro X, Ableton Live, iZotope RX, Music Composition, Piano, Guitar, Voice. 

- Consultation: 
I provide consultation for artists, labels, managers, recording studios, software companies, and corporate entities with information tailored to their unique needs. This ranges from how to set up their recording environments for optimal sound, data-driven marketing approaches, how to ensure complete collection of royalties, and best practices for mixing/mastering.

More about me 
-------------------------------- 
I am an Audio Engineer based in Lisbon, Portugal, where I  run a successful audio studio. 
 
As a student, I earned a degree in Electrical Engineering. Then, I taught Math and Physics for a while, but when I started teaching Audio Production in a school in Lisbon, I became hooked on audio forever! I have now taught Music Production and Audio Production in educational institutions for over 15 years. 
 
In addition to my academic background, I&#039;ve always been connected to show business, through music, radio, and the performing arts. I was even a radio host for more than ten years! This is one of the main reasons why I love helping others improve their podcast so much. 

When I am not teaching or editing audio, you can find me at the gym, soaking in the sun at the beach, experimenting with electronics (I am a big fan of domotics), or playing with my daughter in the park.
 
I look forward to learning about your audio project.","           68,832.14",2417,               28.47,8,[UpworkerLink](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01d3ed911c578e1997)

Jason C.,Los Angeles,"Trend-savvy Electronic Music Producer, Composer, and DJ","üåé It&#039;s me, Jason. Wonder what I can do for you? 

I&#039;m a music artist with 5+ years of Music Production, Songwriting, and Mixing &amp; Mastering experience, currently pursuing my career in üå¥ Los Angeles: pop music&#039;s hometown! 

YOU should consider me for your needs because I LISTEN üëÇ. I listen to the customer. I listen to all types of music. I listen to the minutest details in the work I produce to make sure we can fulfill projects with the thinnest margins for error. I WILL instill your project with the right amounts of creativity and passion.

If that&#039;s not convincing enough, read on...

Through playing classical piano since age 5 üë∂, I gained exposure to Music Theory, Ear Training, Live Performance, and Competitions. I am proud to be a 2x winner of the United States Open Music Competition [Treasury of Contemporary, Intermediate Level &#039;10; Senior Level &#039;13].

It went all downhill from there. (No, just kidding.)

I taught myself how to produce by spending all my time watching tutorials. The first 20 to 30 beats I ever made were . . . not very good . . . so let&#039;s not talk about that! üóëÔ∏è But in 2016, in the middle of studying electrical engineering at UCLA, I decided to pursue a music artist career seriously. 

By deciding to leave UCLA, I doubled down on my passion by applying to the California College of Music in Pasadena, CA in 2019. There, I enrolled in the Certificate in Songwriting &amp; Music Production and learned all about Songwriting, Production, Composition, Mixing, Studio Equipment, Live Audio, etc. I graduated the program in March 2021!

One of the culminating projects for school was making our own EPs. The EP I made was a 3-track project inspired by Porter Robinson, Jaden Smith, and JuiceWRLD. It was self-composed, written, produced, mixed, and mastered. 

I am currently diving in headfirst into my solo music artist career. In the meantime, I hope to collide worlds with you and make as much stuff as we can together. Let&#039;s talk soon!

(TL;DR) - My strongest strengths are my LISTENING &amp; communication skills, attention to detail, emulation of popular styles, and experience working across a breadth of modern pop music genres.

üìú COLD HARD FACTS:
- Co-Founder of Coast Boys Collective artist collective (Google us and check us out!)
- Pro Tools 12 Certified (2020)
- Also familiar with FL Studio and Logic Pro X
- Engineering Credits: 15+
- Song Credits: 10+

(After Effects, Cinema 4D, Premiere, Audition, Illustrator, Photoshop, Live2D Cubism, Camtasia)

Hello, thanks for visiting my profile!  Here is a basic outline of my skills and experience:                                                 


                                                      VIDEO PRODUCTION, DESIGN,
                                         ANIMATION (2D/2.5D/3D/Augmented Reality),
                             
I have an Envato Elements account for stock images, video, music, and sound fx:

My primary video editing/2D animation software programs are Adobe Premiere and Adobe After Effects, of which AE is now integrated and partnering with Maxon&#039;s Cinema 4D, my 3D software. I am also highly proficient in Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator where I do design work and graphics prep for video productions.  For quality live screen capturing, I produce in OBS Studio and Camtasia software.

                                                            AUDIO PRODUCTION:

I am a lifelong musician (5 instruments), composer, and sound engineer and have been producing in Adobe Audition since it was still &quot;Cool Edit Pro&quot; in 2003. These productions include original music,  gaming sound,  genuine foley sound effects, full soundtrack productions, voiceovers, podcasts, children&#039;s stories, and many others. 

                                                                     OTHER SKILLS:

My most vital skill is the conceptualization and ideation process itself, and It gives me such an interest in video production, animation, and music.  I am particularly great at taking disparate concepts and bringing them together into a cohesive flow to explain a concept or tell a story. 

I earned a Bachelor&#039;s degree in philosophy from the University of North Florida and I have highly developed analytical and writing skills that I am constantly utilizing to help my clients with their writing needs.  I am frequently called on to manage scriptwriting, storyboards, copywriting, editing, presentations, and more in my work.   

                                 LOCATION AND AVAILABILITY:

I live in Jacksonville, Florida (-5GMT) where I launched Avalon Studios about ten years ago.  I work as a single contractor/business owner but have frequently hired and successfully managed multiple contractors for large projects. As such, I can manage and produce larger contracts with trusted and proven contractors at my side.  My availability is flexible and generous, so when needed, I am willing to accommodate any time zone and schedule.  

Contract-wise, I enjoy doing various kinds of individual projects. Still, I am particularly interested in developing more long-term relationships in more specific contexts with individuals and organizations I resonate. 


                                             ****************

**STANDARD CONTRACT TERMS/RULES OF ENGAGEMENT** 

Please be sure to review these basic terms prior to awarding a project: 

1. Unless otherwise stated in the proposal, one round of minor technical revisions is included on any project of less than 500 words, if needed (hissing, background noises, hum, etc). 

2. The revision policy does not apply to script changes. Script changes will incur additional an additional recording fee of 50% of the project budget (whether fixed price of hourly rate). 

3. Once a sample or demo is approved, the VO talent will record the project in-line with that sample or demo as close as possible. Requests for extreme tone changes after sample or demo approval are not covered under the revision policy. 

4. Any technical or speech errors will be immediately corrected free of charge and are not considered revisions. 

5. For projects less than 500 words, minor revisions of up to 500 words total are covered in the revision policy. 

Requests for revisions beyond 500 words will incur additional charges.

6. Hourly projects are per PRODUCTION HOUR, not finished.  A one hour minimum charge may apply for smaller projects.  This is subject to project review.

7. All projects subject to materials review prior to any commencement of the work.  I find myself putting placeholder bids on many projects due to lack of information, such as budget, length, deadline, audio format, file separation, usage rights, etc.  I like to avoid misunderstandings with projects, and this is the best to way to achieve that.  This applies to both fixed price and hourly projects.

8. All projects to be kept on the Upwork forum.  Hourly projects will be timed using the Upwork timing algorithm, per Upwork policies.

9. Script revisions I make or any script writing I perform is subject to additional charges, based on the script requirements.

10.  All scripts and pronunciation guides are the responsibility of the client.   VO will not make unpaid corrections for pronunciation errors that could have been handled prior to recording.  This especially applies to medical, technology, and financial scripts that may have difficult words or acronyms that need to be sounded out.  It is your responsibility to provide the pronunciation that is correct.

11.   I review all project details carefully.  Please do not solicit or entertain trying to lower my rates, it will not usually go anywhere.  I have no interest in low paying You Tube narration jobs that pay $10 for a 15 minute script.  This is my job, and it cost me time and money to produce work, the same as it does for you.  Please be mindful that you are considering and/or hired me for a skill set that is specialized, and should be treated as such.  I realize cost is a factor, but I am not going to invest time and other resources to make peanuts.

‚ú® Some 5-starts reviews from clients ‚ú®

&quot;Walder is a MASTER!... I was extremely satisfied with his work, the result was beyond what I was expecting... you can tell an artist made this!... 
When I  first listened to the track, there was basically a standing ovation in my mind,!... 
I ended with tears in my eyes because I can feel he not only used his talent but also put passion and dedication to achieve what I was looking for.  I ended with no words to thank him! He understood exactly what this project was about and he delivered not only extraordinary results but also in less time than initially projected... I didn&#039;t even have to make any changes it was just perfect.
Not only he was able to recreate what I was looking for but he also added more details that made the final result shine even more. Only a real artist can do that!&quot;

&quot;Walder is fantastic-- his turnaround is incredibly quick and the quality of his recordings is outstanding. Additionally, he was very supportive in helping us verify that our translations were correct and accurate, both in terms of grammar and meaning. Highly recommend working with him!&quot;

&quot;Walder was a delight to work with. He completed the project quickly with an extremely high level of professionalism. I will use him again and recommend him to colleagues.&quot;","           38,028.22",10,"            3,565.15",13,[UpworkerLink](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~016ea044cd3e55c52c)

Yves M.,Longueuil,Composer - Sound Designer,"I am Yves Matar, a Canadian sound designer and composer for Visual Media. My father being a sound engineer, I have been around studios since very young, and found my passion to be in sound. I have found a deep fascination for game audio specifically, especially when working on my thesis, where I produced my own VR game on Unreal paired with FMOD following the life of Gibran Khalil Gibran, and studied how different intervallic sizes in microtonal elements paired with the sonic soundscape could alter the emotive perception of the scenario one is in.

Though my experience has been primarily in linear media, I find myself increasingly drawn to interactive media. I have worked on sound design, composition, and dubbing in French and Arabic for TV series, documentaries, and films for the past 8 years. As a freelancer, I have worked on several orchestration projects for local and international artists with production houses such as ‚ÄúHaut de Gamme‚Äù, and engineers such as Eddy Jazra. I have also worked on sound design and music for documentaries and short films with international companies such as &quot;Universal Media and Publishing&quot; in the Sultanate of Oman. One of the tracks made for a short promotional video there earned me a spot among the top 10 winners in the second round of the Oticons Faculty International Film Music Competition. I was also a music engraver for Korean TV series ‚ÄúMeow: The Secret Boy‚Äù, and ‚ÄúQueen: Love and War‚Äù with composer Hagyeong Yeo. With the current situation in the world, I am using the quarantine to produce my own DotA 2 music pack.

James K.,Cicero,"Producer, Creative Consultant, Former Full Stack Developer","I&#039;ve always been someone who likes to experiment, learn new things, and look beyond traditional beliefs and assumptions. For example, In grade school, my teacher gave us an assignment to read a novel and write a summary. I asked if I could write a piece of music inspired by the book instead, and to my surprise, she said yes!

I picked Bram Stoker&#039;s Dracula, which is still one of my favorite books to this day. After reading it, I sat down at our family piano and started composing. My objective was to capture the eerie feel of the Transylvanian countryside and the ominous silhouette of the Count&#039;s castle against a dark blue sky through the eyes of the lead character, Jonathan Harker, as he approached in his stagecoach. The result was a two-page solo piano piece with a haunting melody and some fancy finger work. I even calligraphed the title in a Gregorian-style handwriting at the top of the page. My teacher gave me an A+ for creativity.

These days, I&#039;m still all about trying new things that challenge the boundaries of established beliefs, whether utilizing my skills in digital design, writing catchy scripts for videos and ads, capturing location sound for films, coding websites and apps, or learning something entirely new. And, despite having a robust and diverse creative skillset, I also excel in mathematics and logistics. My experience in composing intricate musical pieces, building websites and games, building and managing web servers, and running small businesses has equipped me with proficiencies in engineering and project management. I find satisfaction in blending my imaginative and analytical abilities to achieve success.

When I&#039;m not working, you can usually find me tinkering around with personal projects like using decision matrices to pick dinner spots with my wife, organizing my ideas in Trello, keeping track of our finances with spreadsheets, or building new furniture for my home or office. I also love going for walks with my wife and dog, and biking around the city.

If you&#039;re looking for someone who is passionate, creative, and always eager to take on new challenges, I&#039;d love to chat. Check out my portfolio below and let&#039;s grab a virtual coffee sometime.

Chris d.,San Diego,"Voicover, Music Composition &amp; Saxophone","I&#039;m Chris.

I&#039;m from sunny California where the people are creative, hard working and always on the move.

I&#039;m happiest when I&#039;m creating unique, epic content but I also like to open the doors to creativity and let the magic happen.

For me, the world is too full of people with a narrow vision. We need more free-spirited visionaries. This became crystal clear for me when I realized that too many settle for the first idea that comes around... I see so much &quot;just so-so&quot; voiceover and music in online content.. I noticed that people are in a hurry, rushing for the deadline; but sometimes quality takes a few tries. Some things require patience, revision and extra effort!

I had to do something about it. I decided to join teams with driven, inspired creatives who would like to join me in my passion for creating the best we can..

In the past, I set my sights and bar too low, undervaluing myself and attracting less-than-inspiring work, wasted a lot of time and effort, and got sidetracked by jobs that weren&#039;t right for me.. It hasn&#039;t been easy, but in the end I&#039;ve re-aligned my focus toward what sparks my creative passions..

Now my mission is to keep bringing stories and ideas to life with my voice and music..

Count on me to voice your script just as you like it. Count on me to bring your musical idea to fruition or completion. I am a multi-instrumentalist composer, songwriter and producer.

Zlatko A.,Pancevo,Podcast Audio Editor - Product Photo Editor,"‚òÖ Top Rated ‚òÖ

Let me introduce myself briefly: I am a very dedicated, responsible, precise, detail-oriented and proactive worker. I own a broad spectrum of working experience, ranging from audio editing, photo editing, podcast mastering, and editing, across music creation, intro recording, jingle music to voice over services.

-Remove Mistakes
I can edit your podcast episodes for conciseness (removing excessive &quot;um&#039;s,&quot; &quot;you knows,&quot; repetitive words, and foibles).  I can splice words and sentences and put them back together again seamlessly so that your audience won&#039;t be able to tell you made a mistake.  I can also take out long pauses to keep your conversation flowing smoothly.

-Noise Reduction &amp; Sound Improvement
I can remove distracting background noise, hiss, pops, clicks, mic bumps, and loud breaths.  I can level out the volume of you and your guests&#039; voices.  I can then add equalization and compression for a broadcast quality sound.

-Mixing &amp; Mastering
I can mix your recording with your intro, outro, and sponsorship ads in the Adobe Audition multitrack editor, normalize your audio to broadcast standard, and upload your files to a hosting service or email your mp3 or wav files.

-Intro/Outro Creation
I can create and mix Intro and Outro for your podcast show.

Tom L.,Milwaukee,"Audio/Video-Writer, Voice Talent, Producer, Editor","I have been creating audio/video projects for many mediums since 1995.  

*Broadcast Audio/Video-  I have created broadcast commercial spots for both radio and television.  These spots have been local, regional, and national.  I have been involved in all aspects of projects including: writing, voicing, sound designing, editing, producing.

*Non-Broadcast Audio/Video-  If you need on-hold messages, a trade show video, a web marketing video, or want to introduce yourself on your website.  Showing potential clients what you do only increases the amount of time someone will stay on your web page.  I like to help close the deal. 

*Voice Talent-  Whether you need help writing, voicing, or producing, this was how I &quot;cut my teeth&quot; in the business and is still my passion.  You let me know what you need and I will get you there.  That is a promise.

These are just a few highlights as I have been involved of all aspects in both audio and video production.  I have learned over the last 20 plus years that if you don&#039;t have satisfied clients you have nothing.  I pride myself on exceeding the expectations of clients and turning around projects before deadlines.  That is just how I work.

Orrie D.,Macedonia,Audio Editor &amp; Mix Engineer with Audition/Logic/Pro Tools Expertise,"Hey! 

I am excited for the opportunity to help you on your next project!

Starting as a producer/guitar player years ago, I have since completed a degree in audio, gained certifications and expertise in Pro Tools, Logic Pro and Audition, as well as earned credits as a mix engineer.

As an audio editor I can quickly assist you with removing that unwanted noise, stutters, repetition, or crutch words (such as ‚Äúum‚Äôs,‚Äù &quot;like,&quot; &quot;kinda,&quot; &quot;sorta,&quot; etc.) from your recordings. I will also  add your selected music, sound design, and deliver a fully mixed and mastered audio render; adding polish using advanced post-production tools/techniques, and exporting your deliverables at the appropriate loudness standards for the platform(s) you plan to upload to.

With a degree in audio and many years of audio editing experience, I have worked on a variety of projects: podcast editing, live band recording, game soundtracks, artist collaborations, and many other projects. In order to maintain a quality and efficient workflow, I have templates within my DAW ready for the editing and mixing of many genres of music or dialogue.

Kirill T.,Batumi,Advanced Vocal Production | Music Production | Mixing | Mastering,"15+ years of experience. One of Upwork&#039;s top 3% freelancers.
Frustrated that most producers always show the &quot;after&quot; and never the &quot;before&quot;? I&#039;ll show you both. I have an extensive portfolio with BEFORE vs AFTER examples showcasing my music production, vocal processing, audio editing, mixing and mastering skills.

‚ô¶Ô∏èMixing and Mastering‚ô¶Ô∏è

I can mix and master anything to industry standards regardless of genre or style.
‚Ä¢	I will make your track sound just as loud, dense and bright as the rest of your playlist;
‚Ä¢	I will smooth out all the unpleasant frequencies so that everything blends in perfectly;
‚Ä¢	I will work on creating multiple sound dimensions within the song using various types of space and stereo processing;
‚Ä¢	I will make sure that all the elements are equally audible and have their own place in the mix.

‚ô¶Ô∏èAdvanced Vocal Production‚ô¶Ô∏è
 
Have a good singing voice and decent recording equipment but your vocals never sound like what you hear in your favorite songs?

By using a combination of various advanced vocal mixing and editing techniques I can solve that problem. 
‚Ä¢	I can manually tune the vocals to make them sound exactly on pitch while still very natural (with Melodyne and Antares);
‚Ä¢	I can fix all the timing issues and make sure that all the vocal layers are perfectly aligned (with Revoice Pro);
‚Ä¢	I can do doubling (if you provide multiple takes) to make the vocals sound wide and rich.
‚Ä¢	I can make sure your vocals are crisp and stable in terms of volume and frequency spectrum (with EQ, multiband compression, limiting and saturation).
‚Ä¢	I can make your recording sound bigger, more life-like and multi-layered by applying different kinds of reverb and delay.
‚Ä¢	I can reduce excessive breath and sibilance.
 
While mixing vocals is tedious to most producers, it&#039;s oddly satisfying to me. This is why it&#039;s one of my strongest suits.
 
‚ô¶Ô∏èMusic Production‚ô¶Ô∏è
 
Over the years of working as a freelancer I&#039;ve become quite versatile as a producer and have mastered the techniques needed to compose, arrange, produce and remix a whole variety of genres and styles from scratch, including:
 
‚Ä¢	All kinds of EDM - House (Slap House, Deep House, Future House, Progressive House, Electro House, Tropical House), Trance (Progressive Trance, Uplifting Trance), Midtempo, Bigroom, Future Bass;
‚Ä¢	Retro (Synthwave, Synthpop, Disco, Cyberpunk);
‚Ä¢	Chill (Lo-fi, Ambient, Meditation Music);
‚Ä¢	Acoustic (Piano, Cinematic, Trailer Music); 
‚Ä¢	Hip-hop, Trap;
‚Ä¢	Anything Pop.
I‚Äôll make a track around your lyrics or melodies in any of these styles even if it&#039;s just a rough idea recorded on your phone.
I have music in my portfolio in all of these genres - just tell me if you&#039;re interested in hearing a particular style.

I&#039;ve used the skills listed above to make music and process various kinds of audio for music-related apps, businesses and my own creative projects. I&#039;ve ghost-produced for other artists, had my music released on record labels, and I‚Äôd be happy to help you translate your vision into a polished, competitive and radio-ready product as well.

Erik H.,Denver,"Audio Editing for Film, Television, and Internet","I am the owner of Hear No Evil Media.  My audio production company has worked on mobile apps, sound design for film, numerous health organization podcasts and internet radio, and various website audio projects.

I graduated from Shoreline College with a 4.0 in Digital Audio Engineering as well as a degree in Music Business.  I also graduated Summa cum Laude from the University of Colorado with a BS in Music. 

I&#039;ve mentored with Paul Robb of Think Tank and and internationally known, platinum selling recording artists Information Society.  I&#039;ve held a residency at Seattle&#039;s historic Soundhouse Studios with Jack Endino (Nirvana, Soundgarden) and Steve Fisk. And I continue to grow and learn from my peers, professors, and experts in the field of audio engineering.

I have worked as a producer and performer for the entire sound replacement of a feature film.  This included finding and hiring voice actors, editing audio, foley performances, score supervision, and voice acting myself.

Recently, I was the sound editor for a feature length documentary (Klocked) that is currently making the festival circuit.  It has already won two awards and is being invited to many more domestic and international film festivals.

I&#039;ve recorded several albums for artists with one of them reaching to #2 in sales in the Seattle area.  I have recently completed two new albums in the Denver area for local artists that are about to launch.

In Seattle, I ran, edited, and produced a podcast for Shoreline College.  The podcast started as a local artist spotlight with interviews and live in-studio performances.  This branched out into a podcast for the entire college regarding performances outside of the recording department, live ensemble shows on location, and interviews with staff and faculty.

I have been editing and producing audio since the early 2000s with a formal education following just a few years later.  I have interned at two recording studios in Seattle and Denver.  I am a member of two different honor societies, the recoding academy of arts and sciences, and the national audio engineering society.","           27,421.26",784,               34.96,10,[UpworkerLink](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0180f707002d8f65c5)
Dave V.,Cebu,Top Podcast Producer and Consultant,"Dave here and I help over 100 business owners and influencers reach a wider yet targeted audience through podcasting!

(Feel free to book a free consultation and discovery call with me: calendly.com/davevisaya)

As an aspiring musician, I&#039;ve been playing around with audio production since 2009. It must have been fate that I landed a job at the best website for real estate investors (BiggerPockets), which happens to have a podcast. It was inevitable that I&#039;ll be editing their podcast. The rest is history. Now, I have helped over 150 podcasters launch their shows and I&#039;m looking forward to helping more!

After editing hundreds of podcast episodes and producing a couple of ones, I discovered that podcasting is more than just editing out the awkward pauses and annoying noises. It is also about making sure the listeners get to clearly understand the message and have a superb experience at the same time!

Quite a number of podcasters and guests may not notice this but they can sound different on the recordings‚Äîto the point where they can come across as unprepared or unconfident. I believe this can be minimized or controlled at a certain level with good editing and audio engineering skills.

With over 7 years of podcast editing and production experience under my belt, I can now easily spot the difference between shows that excel and shows that do not. I believe any show can be amazing provided all the essentials are taken care of accordingly.

The idea was simple: turn every podcast from ordinary to amazing by making sure all the important bases are covered. In essence, that‚Äôs how we came to be‚Äîyour best resource when it comes to your podcast editing needs!

But hey, talk is cheap. That being said, you might as well take advantage of our free trial so you can see what we can do for you.

I‚Äôve also produced and published podcasts like Marketing in Yoga Pants, Growth Marketing Today, Simplewholesaling, PassportJoy, and much more!

This is the first time I&#039;ve ever heard Tom Askin as a narrator and he does excellent job.  He hits all the right notes and gets you really emotionally invested in the story and the characters.  He gets you to really feel for these characters, especially the weight in the gravitas of everything this doctor feels and goes through to save people during these events.&quot;

&quot;Tom Askin is absolutely the perfect narrator for this story. I can‚Äôt imagine anyone else voicing Dr. Ethan King.&quot;

&quot;Choosing Tom Askin for the narrator of this book was brilliant. His voice (which voice can be make or break it for me when it comes to audiobooks) is perfect and exactly how I would imagine Dr. King&#039;s voice to sound. &quot;

&quot;The narrator did a fantastic job bringing life to the characters and making them 3 dimensional. You could feel the pain and horror the characters were experiencing.&quot;

&quot;The narrator truly does an excellent job of drawing you into the story, making you care about the characters and actually feel the powerful emotions.&quot;

&quot;The narrator does a fantastic job of emitting the thoughts, emotions and his characters are real enough to be believed.&quot;

Drew S.,Austin,Audio Engineer/Sound Designer,"Growing up in a family with myriad different cultural backgrounds, I started early with an appreciation for a broad range of ideas and perspectives. Equally early, I developed an immense love for music and sound, beginning as an avid listener and eventually picking up drumsticks as my primary means of expression.

I began my career in university, holding the titles Extreme Music Coordinator and Music Director at WBUL at USF in Tampa, FL. I then graduated with an Associate‚Äôs degree in Recording Arts and a Master‚Äôs in Entertainment Business from Full Sail in Orlando, FL. During my time there, I was chosen to participate in the competitive Full Sail Dubbing Stage internship program, as well as assisting for F.O.H. mixer at the Live at Park Ave. Series.

After university, I spent almost 2 years teaching English in Japan, fulfilling one of my early dreams to experience the country first-hand. During my stay, I rehearsed, played live, and recorded with 3 bands, and taught English at 3 different high schools. After moving back to the States, I started working back in my native Florida, while performing with Lion Choir and The Wallies, several music/dance collaborations, improvisational events, and playing cover band gigs.

Within 2 years I made the move to Austin, TX for the thriving music scene, working at Guitar Center and eventually getting a job at MOOD Media as a Production Engineer. Then making a move to Encore (formerly PSAV) as Audio Technician, and then Sales Coordinator. 

Why I&#039;m a great candidate for your project:

Audio:

‚Ä¢	Recording/Editing/Mixing -- I have extensive experience with the breadth of music production across genres and applications, including popular music, classical, and theatrical productions.
‚Ä¢	Audio post-production -- Dialogue editing and placement, spotting, SFX placement, foley, and ADR. 
‚Ä¢	Composition &amp; SFX creation -- For a multitude of visual arts accompaniment including film, dance, live productions.
‚Ä¢	Education -- Drums and percussion lessons as well as recording and DAW fundamentals

Design &amp; Development:

‚Ä¢	Website building -- I&#039;ve built my own websites using CMSes like Wix and SquareSpace and have some experience with coding HTML.
‚Ä¢      Programming -- Completed WGU Python 4 pilot intensive program
‚Ä¢	Graphic design -- I&#039;ve worked on plenty of my album artwork, posters, flyers, and promotional materials for my music projects, friends, and freelance jobs. I have an eye for layout, and I work primarily in Photoshop and Illustrator.
‚Ä¢	Copywriting &amp; marketing -- I&#039;ve written promotional materials for my own shows, dozens of other creative projects, and office jobs. I have also drafted project proposals to be used in grant proposals which require a detail-oriented and concise approach to communicating.

Coordinating:

‚Ä¢	Communication -- As Sales Coordinator for Encore, I acted as liaison between the clients, the W Hotel (which housed my location), and the audio-visual technicians that worked on events that I helped plan. This experience has helped sharpen my interpersonal communication skills in-person, on the phone, and through e-mail.
‚Ä¢	Productivity tools -- At Encore, I also learned software systems for project scheduling, gear acquisition, and CRM, including proprietary tools. I feel confident that I can learn to use your systems and I look forward to learning your workflow.
‚Ä¢	Freelancing -- I have been freelancing for over 10 years as a drummer, audio engineer, and composer. For the last 3 years I have also been working remotely from my home office/studio. 

Here is a list of productivity software that I have used throughout my career:

- Slack
- Jira
- Trello
- Microsoft 365 (Outlook, Teams, Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
- Apple processors (Pages, Keynote, Numbers)

Marco A.,Treviso,"Bilingual Writer, Translator and Marketing Manager","&quot;The soul may be and is in the mass of men drugged and silenced by the seductions of sense and the deception of the world.

Hi! My name&#039;s Marco. I&#039;m a writer, translator and content creator. Over the years, I&#039;ve written articles for creative, tech, and fashion brands renowned worldwide, acted as a book editor, written art and business essays, managed social media content for businesses of all kinds.

As for my education, through some apparent oversight, I graduated in Arts Management from the Ca&#039; Foscari University of Venice. I later earned a diploma in Music Business from the London School of Sound.

Like many others, I&#039;m the result of an unquantifiable amount of mistakes and U-turns, which happened to be my creative side&#039;s favourite form of nourishment.

Portfolio updated once a year (Q1).

***UPDATE*** 
And now featuring HYBRID EVENT SERVICES in the New York Tri-State area + Globally! We&#039;ve come up with a Hybrid workflow that is watchable, entertaining, lean, and cost-effective; we can even hybridize an event on the most obscure platforms.  In person, we just need a room with decent acoustics and a &quot;stage&quot;. If you have an HDMI projector / monitor and decent wifi, we can bring in a virtual guest. We can record the whole thing, make content out of it, etc.
INQUIRE TODAY!

My name is Amardeep. I also go by Gill. I could argue that I&#039;m one of the best in the world at what I do. 

I make stellar virtual events happen. 
White-Glove Media Production, Delivered At Rapid Speeds, at a Below-Market Rate.

I am a Top Rated Plus Livestream producer here on Upwork, and I&#039;ve been doing game-changing content elsewhere since 2014.  I have a storied background in show-business, having successfully worked closely with famous comedians and actors. I take this experience of working with talent, and bring that to clients who are not necessarily performers by trade.

With the explosive popularity in Zoom Conferencing [and broadcasting tools like it], the demand for evolving the use of these tools has also grown. I am very ahead of the game in terms of transforming these broadcasts into something more, and have been able to build a boutique agency around it. Making a client&#039;s broadcast look good has its value I suppose. 


Notable clients include: 
-Microsoft
-Design Miami (Perennial Client)
-Codeland Conference (Annual Client)
-American Diabetes Association (Perennial Client)

-United Nations (Delegations)

-As of September 2020, I am a &quot;Top Rated Plus&quot; service provider on this platform. This is a commendation for my ability to receive stellar feedback on big ($10k+) contracts. 
-As of Spring 2021, I have two part-time employees that help me execute events.
-As of April 2021, I am a member of the Upwork Talent Innovation Network Cloud.
-No games here. All my earnings + reviews are public and 100% authentic.

Please inquire so that we can set up a quick introductory meeting and perhaps even move forward. You can tentatively book an event timeslot with me, but it isn&#039;t official until a contract is sent and agreed to. 

If you are looking for someone to emcee/facilitate your meeting, it just so happens I&#039;ve done my fair share of that as well. Feel free to inquire about opportunities for spokespeople.

Michael A G.,Jackson Township,"AudioBook Editor, tons of audio, commercial/ACX narration exp.","Hi all, 
I have Narrated, edited, mastered and produced literally hundreds of audio books for Audible/ACX...Additionally, I&#039;ve also done audio work for many projects, including other (Non-Audible Related) audio books, podcast intros / corporate and commercial media audio .... so, yes I have experience doing this stuff!
Also I have solely edited lots of audio for companies and individuals.
The $50.. per hour price is 50 PFH (per finished hour for narration) which typically only relates to Audio-Books, in other words, if your audio book is three hours (about 30,000 words) then it would cost a total of $150 for the project, even though it takes longer than that to record edit and master the project.
The bottom line, is that when it comes to audio book work, you usually know exactly how much it will cost in advance.If you have recorded the Audio-book yourself, the price can vary widely depending on the recorded quality and what must be done to bring it into conformity.

PLEASE NOTE: Any hourly work that runs over 20 hours automatically gets its hourly rate reduced by 20%.

Prices for SHORT-FORM narration vary by project due to the many variables, music track etc...
Just contact me so we can discuss exact pricing... it will be reasonable!
In other words &quot;EVERYTHING is NEGOTIABLE!&quot;
All audio was recorded and mastered by me, using my studio which utilizes professional-grade gear.

Alex G.,Buenos Aires,Podcast Producer for Personal Development Brands,"Here&#039;s the key to GROWING YOUR BUSINESS using podcasts:

Imagine finding a 5-star review on your podcast of someone saying &quot;OMG! This week&#039;s episode changed my life! Thank you SO much!&quot; and knowing that new comment is not just one more follower. It&#039;s a new FAN. 

One who will follow you on other social media platforms, sign up for your newsletter, and buy your products. And knowing that because you&#039;re confident your audience RESONATES with your shows so much, that they&#039;ll listen to every single episode. And then want more. 

Some time ago, a client of mine started two shows at roughly the same time. One was simply repurposed recordings from a different platform (kept raw). The other had interviews that I edited. The results were night and day. The edited version had consistently 3x downloads. But what&#039;s more important: over 80% of people were going back and listening to every single older episode.

That means an ENGAGED audience. They saw the host as an expert who was giving them value, and they wanted MORE. The second show not only didn&#039;t grow... it shrank. Only a handful of first-time listeners checked out other episodes, and even then... they left soon after. The difference was in the VALUE they felt they were getting. 

If you want to be seen as an expert and get the most out of your show (even if you don&#039;t have experience or time), focus on your audience first, give them what they want, and they&#039;ll turn into raving fans. The best way to grow your show is with followers. This is how you get more followers.

And that&#039;s where I come in. I&#039;ll not only coach you with the tech and the best ways to hook your listeners, but I&#039;ll also take your raw audio and make it more ENGAGING to your particular community. And then, you&#039;ll be able to promote your products, books, or courses to an audience who&#039;s excited about everything you create. 

Are you ready? Just send me a message and tell me what your show is about!

Cheers!

Eric F.,Fair Oaks,Audio Edit &amp; Repair | Audiobook Editor | Podcast Editor | Video Editor,"Let me say the most important thing first: I care about your project. I get out of bed in the morning to do great work and make my clients feel confident in their project and well taken care of. I don&#039;t succeed unless you do and I&#039;m going to do everything I can to make that happen. All the rest listed below are just the details.

If you have an existing recording and just need it edited and/or repaired - great, let‚Äôs go!

If you are a complete beginner and need help with recording and getting your project off the ground, don‚Äôt worry! I can walk you through it all.

For seventeen years I have edited, repaired and mastered thousands of hours of spoken word audio. I&#039;ve been in charge of the design and operation of a professional spoken word recording studio, performing all audio engineering tasks, from initial recording to perfecting the sound for publication.

My audio roots are from the old analog days, so I grew up with a solid foundation of audio processes and theory. I will not just be dropping your audio into an artificial intelligence app and clicking a button. I‚Äôll be using the best modern tools such as Izoptope Rx, Logic Pro, Reaper, and a bunch of the most advanced pro-audio plugins on your project. 

Whether your content is a podcast, audiobook, guided meditation, public speech or any other, I will:

- Advise you on how to get a good recording
- Remove unwanted background noise and sounds
- Apply equalization, compression, de-essing and other audio processes
- Remove filler words, false starts and stutters
- Even out the levels and set them to appropriate standards
- Add music, intros and outros if needed
- Generally see to anything that needs perfecting

Please see my portfolio below, page 3, for a link to my website where you can find audio cleanup examples.

I am also capable with basic video editing and have experience getting my client&#039;s video edited and looking good for YouTube and other end uses.

I look forward to applying this experience to your project. I‚Äôll always try to make you feel like you have a reliable, available and invested partner. I think my success in that mission is confirmed below in my five star reviews. So take a look at those, and then let‚Äôs get to work.

With studies in Berklee College of Music and Alchemea College of Audio Engineering and a passion for both editing and recording, I can advise clients for the recording stage. A great show starts with a great recording.

Amanda de Andrade is a Bilingual (American-Brazilian) voice actress who has a full voice range with a natural advantage on conversational, warm, and confident approaches. However, learned vocal skills in the last years broadened her palette to unlimited and always-new colors and nuances. 

Amanda has worked on various musical and acting projects since she was a teenager, including audiobook narration, on-stage presentations, and singing. In the last four years, she has been fully committed to the VO career and has brought verified success to her clients in all of these categories: Ads, In-Company Presentations, Documentaries, Educational, Telephone Systems, Apps, Games, Podcast and Animation. Her voice is on the BBC Radio, in many US Universities, in apps for kids, and in apps for grown-ups... and you can&#039;t even notice that it is the same voice, the same Amanda.

She has worked for +50 of the 500-fortune companies and even more agencies, studios, small businesses, and startups.

Amanda was the first voice of Asana Rebel App in Portuguese; she is the official voice of KenHub in Brazil and is delivering dubbed content for Discovery Education since January 2021.

My work is defined by three important principles: clear and positive communication, total commitment to the client‚Äôs goals and expertise to accomplish every step of the project with complete attention to detail.
1) I value communication. That is why I dedicate myself to understanding the project, clearing any doubts, and keeping the client updated on the progress of my work. This rapport ensures the client that I‚Äôm being guided by their schedule and goals.
2) I commit to the project results. 
Some clients look for suggestions, insights, and guidance from a professional. In most cases, however, the client already knows what they want - and I respect that. I strive to identify their own goals, plan every step - from conception to execution -, and employ the techniques and strategies that will bring the exact results they desire.
3) I aspire after excellency by taking care of every detail.
To me, a voiceover project is more than just reading a script.
My projects include a thorough analysis of the script, niche, and audience, as well as the adaptation of tone, rhythm, and many other voice aspects according to the genre. After the recording and editing stage, I will attentively revise their files to guarantee the correct content, format and technical specifications. This process assures the client that the final product will meet his/her vision. 

----------------

&quot;How did you get here? What&#039;s so special about you?&quot;

I have been acting and singing since childhood. In 2012, I began my formal studies in Music and Performance at UDESC. I worked as a musician and a video talent until 2015, when I started offering voice-over services to companies and entrepreneurs.

At that time, my voice was immediately appreciated for having the qualities required for the Educational, Conversational Advertising, Meditation and Storytelling genres. My valuable experience in many forms of art, as well as my innate creativity, was the door to this diverse realm of possibilities that is the voice-over world. In the same year, I deepened my musical and scientific knowledge by taking a Specialization Certificate on Audio Production at Berklee Online. 

2017 was a very special year in my career. In July of that year, I signed my first Exclusivity Agreement as a Voice Talent with the German Company Asana Rebel. As soon as I noticed such constant and positive feedback from my clients, I recognized that vocal performance was my joy and my business. Since then, I have developed a fast, yet solid, experience in many genres and have had the opportunity to work directly with great companies and teams from more than 20 countries.

Today, I am a full-time voice-over artist with a strong technology background and my own private studio. I‚Äôm currently working on my Certificate on Performing Arts and Storytelling.

I am delighted to say that each and every one of my clients, from small entrepreneurs to recognized multi-national brands, has been completely satisfied with my work. This is tangible proof that encourages me to keep up with the commitment and thoroughness that continuously bring amazing results to any project in which I collaborate.

Recent reviews:

- Robert was quick to respond, attentive to details and pleasant to work with. He also provided suggestions for what could be done differently when producing the raw material that would improve the process for future projects. This was an added bonus that was very much appreciated and reflects Robert&#039;s genuine interest in producing exceptional work. I will be happy to use Robert for future projects.

That was not part of the job. He&#039;s got years of sound engineering experience and it really shows. I look forward to working with him in the future as well.

Ravikant R.,Waterloo,Professional Video Editor and Videographer,"Hi! I am a professional video editor &amp; videographer who can handle A to Z of video production. Whether it be product launches, interviews, real estate videos, company promos, what have you. There are two sorts of video projects, video projects in context of businesses and video projects that are narrative. The former is a part of a marketing campaign and the latter is an artistic endeavour. I can take care of both for you. 

The key to professional grade video editing is not just the attention to visual appearance, but to also take care of finer details like: 

1) Correction of audio issues from on-location mic (or background hums, other ambient sounds, etc) 
2) Colour correction. 
3) Correcting sync issues. 
4) Adding Titles in a way that is unobtrusive. 
5) Cutting interviews with minimal stalls, pauses. 
6) Adding sound effects, creating a detailed sound bed in case of advertisements and short films. 
7) Applying the principles of film editing to make better videos, whether they be product adverts or travel vlogs. 
8) Using B-roll and reaction shots to add more substance to the video. 

So I am a detail-driven video editor with creative focus revolving  around all aspects of editing including dialog editing, sound design/correction, colour correction. Please see the linked videos for samples and quality of work done.","           16,581.35",329,               50.35,9,[UpworkerLink](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01b6ff1ce305c7392d)

ACCENTS AND DIALECTS

Terry can play the big broad comedic Frenchman, German, or Russian, but he can also do the subtle, real version of accents and dialects. And---
Terry is an excellent Mimic - if you&#039;re looking for that odd accent or vocal quality He can pull it off.

Neal B.,Cagayan de Oro,Creative Video and Audio Specialist | Podcast | YouTube | Social Media,"&quot;Neal, Mate, Holy smoke! You just nailed the task. It is a bit of a mess for you to work with and I cannot even tell how hard it is but man... You really are a master of your art&quot;

A feedback from one of of my satisfied clients.

The quality of your podcast and audio recordings is of my top priority. I am not just an audio editor but a creative sound designer as well. I specialize in audio enhancement, restoration and design. A living one stop shop for audio matters.

Each and every recording is different. The ambient noises around differ too. Oftentimes, it is so frustrating to record a high quality podcast interview with a very poor audio quality. Quality is of the essence for the listeners and I deeply understand that.

No matter the quality of your recordings, we can make it of top caliber by the proven methods I used for 11 years of working in the radio and podcast industry. I do not rely on templates and presets because I consider that every recording is different- which means that they need distinct equalization, amount and technique of restoration (noise removal), compression and mastering.  

And even your voice needs a distinct and unique equalization and compression to achieve the best possible fine-tuned enhancement for your voice quality. 

With the right tools and software (Adobe Audition, Izotope Ozone, Izotope Nectar, Era-D, Era-N, Izotope RX, Zynaptiq) and with the right combination and layering of those, I had successfully accomplished a wide array of audio recordings- from business, self-help, fashion, christian podcasts to creative stories and radio jingles and advertisement.

Let me help you with that! And together, we can make your audio projects the best that it can be.

And it&#039;s a plus because I do have a lot of experience  in video editing too- from screencasts to vlogs to one-minute videos, Facebook ad product videos, YouTube channel intros and end screen, speaker and sizzle reel.

He has excellent audio editing skills and attention to detail when editing the audio, he did the work quickly despite being a large project and was very easy to communicate with. I will be rehiring him as our regular podcast editor immediately.&quot; - Amy Whitney, Real English Conversations Podcast. 

If you are looking for a podcast editor who can take your raw recording and transform them into professional-sounding podcats then you are at the right place! If you have regular based, weekly episodes let us build a long-term relationship and make a great podcast together!

I&#039;m a sound engineer with a bachelor&#039;s degree in audio engineering and a lot of practical experience in podcast editing and post-production. 

You can expect all your audio material to be treated with maximal care because I&#039;m very passionate about sound and I&#039;m always tending to give my best to achieve maximal audio quality. That&#039;s why I decide to be a specialized podcast engineer and I build a special working system for podcast editing. 

So, here is a quick introduction to my workflow. Your podcast will go through four editing stages and three rounds of listening. 

In the first stage, the technical quality of your recording will be increased by removing some downsides of recording like background noise, stems loudness variation, mouth and digital clicks. 

The second and third stage are called ‚Äúcutting‚Äù and ‚Äúpolish‚Äù stage where I cut all unnecessary content like non-content audio, mistakes, filler words (‚Äúahms‚Äù, too frequent ‚Äúright‚Äù, ‚Äúyou know‚Äù....), long pauses, reducing loudness of breaths, removing microphone rumbles and some background sounds if occurs.

The fourth stage is the post-production stage where I&#039;m giving your podcat the best possible quality by using various tools like equalizers, compressor, multichannel compressor, de-esser, enhancers and many others from my big collection. Your episode will get mastered to -16 LUFS to meet podcasts loudness standard.

Here is a list of skills and services that I can offer you:

üéß Removing background noise and hum
üéß Evening stems loudness
üéß Removing mouth clicks, lip smacks, digital clicks
üéß Removing filler words (‚Äúahms‚Äù, too frequent ‚Äúright‚Äù, ‚Äúyou know‚Äù....)
üéß Removing long pauses
üéß Removing and reducing breaths
üéß Removing microphone rumbles
üéß Reducing or removing background sounds

üéß Mastering episode loudness to -16 LUFS (podcats loudness standard)

I‚Äôve worked with startups, long-established brands, non-profits, authors, publishers, printers, and web development teams. I‚Äôve had the privilege to work for individuals with a story to tell and organizations with a product to sell or a mission to share.

My approach to design varies, just as the type of projects I work on can vary. In general, my designs are specifically created to stand out in the world of visual overwhelm. I like to think that sometimes this is achieved with stunning simplicity, sometimes with beautiful complexity, but really it is done by listening to clients, developing an understanding of the audience, and being very  clear about the messages the design needs to convey. 

I‚Äôm well-versed in identity design and brand strategy, typography, graphic design, book &amp; document design / layout, and even audio design. I can manage projects from the initial idea through to their completion. I have significant experience with complex, multi-faceted projects that involve multiple skillsets, and I have no trouble switching between those skills or employing several at once.

Whatever your design project,¬†I‚Äôd love to help you present your words, thoughts, and business in the best way possible.

Jamie F.,Stirling,Professional audiobook/podcast editing and mastering engineer,"Hi there! 

My name is a Jamie Flynn, a musician, an audio engineer and audiobook/podcast editor from Stirling, Scotland. 

With over 10 years of work in both audio production and music, I have valuable experience in a wide range of areas. Recently, I aimed to specialise in audio recording, mixing, editing and production after taking ownership of a music studio which affords me the time, space and resources to produce quality work in this field. 

With regards to audio editing, to date I have edited over 200 podcasts (a mixture of heavy and light editing) with nothing but positive feedback. Alongside this, I have produced over 35 audio books that have passed ACX standards and are currently hosted on Audible, &#039;The Summer Sand Pact&#039; by Jessie Newton (Narrated by Jill Smith) being the most recent upload. I also recently recorded, edited and produced a significant amount of narration for a corporate meditation app, as well as Dr David R Hamilton&#039;s latest work (Hay House UK Publishing)

As I am also a professional musician, I have married my skills in these fields to allow me to write, record and produce my own music to a high standard. These productions proved to be extremely successful in booking a recently completed coast to coast tour of Canada.  

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask! 

I hope to hear from you soon, 

Kind regards,

Adrian P.,Bucharest,Video Editor and Documentary Filmmaker with a decade of experience,"I am Adrian, and I have been working in this field for about ten years as a video editor, director, producer, and creative consultant. 

The services I offer here on Upwork are:
- Audio and video editing (Documentary and fiction film, trailers, podcasts, music videos, webinars, advertising, interviews, and more)
- Sound design
- Color correction
- Text animations
- Creative and technical consulting on all aspects of the video production and post-production process.
- Writing and developing treatments and funding applications for documentary films.

My lengthy experience includes shooting and editing advertising videos, promos, events, podcasts, and music videos.  I have worked with almost all possible formats of capturing a moving image, from 35 mm film to consumer handy-cams and everything in between. This background has given me a deep understanding of the technical aspects of video creation and post-production, as well as the ability to troubleshoot and fix numerous technical issues.

I`m good with deadlines and can quickly grasp what a client wants, and can work independently to come up with creative solutions. I have experience in all stages of the video production process, so I can comfortably communicate well with other creators and decision-makers.
 
Very comfortable with Davinci Resolve, Adobe Premiere, and knowledgeable with other software from the creative suite and beyond.  I own a high-speed and reliable editing workstation with excellent rendering times and a high-speed internet connection for a fast and efficient workflow. 

I am also an award-winning documentary film director. The first feature I directed, together with my partner, won several international festival awards in 2020 and 2021, was broadcast on Romanian national television, and was nominated for the Romanian film industry awards for best documentary and best debut feature.  I have successfully written funding treatments and edited trailers for several national and international film funds.

Every single interaction with him was so far beyond what I expected - he was super responsive, attentive to detail, able to appreciate the job and was incredibly fast with the delivery (under 24 hours end to end). Not only that, but he gave multiple drafts in a useable content and was just a generally awesome human being.

Liam M.,London,"Writer, Actor (Voice/Physical), Music Producer","Hello! My name is Liam Murphy, and I am able to help clients with a range of different processes! Lets take a look at what I can offer you:

Writing:

I graduated from Queen Mary University with a Joint Honours Degree in Drama and English. Whilst studying I penned essays and reviews of many different subjects, from insights into the cultural impact of the Tupac hologram at Coachella, to an analysis of Moby Dick. I also wrote poems that were published in local journals, and wrote and directed a play that was performed in London at the famous Edinburgh Fringe Festival! After a brief period teaching English, I began working as a freelance writer. In the 5-year period I have worked as writer I have communicated with clients across the globe and written in a number of different formats. 

I am incredibly familiar with the worlds of art, film and music which can be evidenced in my article writing for prestigious publications such as DJ Mag, GIGsoup and my own popular blog listencorp. I have written articles for successful travel magazines and business publications as well, including The Luxury Report and The European. I love to write insightful and engaging articles, combining them with an adept knowledge of SEO.

I love to write PR, and have done so for a number of different ventures, from Cybersecurity companies to fantastic music labels releasing incredible music on vinyl and cassette. I am adept at writing meta-descriptions and currently work with a top music library, ensuring that every track they release is described accurately and with thought to SEO search terms.

Due to my experience in making magazines, I can also help you to bring a pamphlet, zine, booklet or introductory guide to life! 

Voice acting:

Since leaving University, my acting talents have been utilised by companies and self-starters all over the world. I have delivered stellar voice acting for charitable causes, artistic blogs and insightful YouTube videos. I love to bring a script to life in a way that is exciting and clear. I am able to instil passion into a voiceover if needs be, and can also utilise my talents to become different characters as well. I have a professional set-up in my home, and am an intermediate user of the audio program Ableton.

Music producer:

I have been making music my whole life. From learning guitar at a young age, I began to play in bands and at local festivals and venues. As I grew up I began to collaborate with other musicians and also offer music for other areas of the artistic realm. This is mostly highlighted in the work I have done for theatre performances. I have composed music and sound for a range plays, from Shakespeare&#039;s Titus Andronicus to a play about asking your boss for a raise! I make music under several different aliases and have had songs played on Radio 1 and NTS Radio. I enjoy making music profusely, and am always up for a challenge.

That is a brief rundown of what I can offer, but don&#039;t be afraid to reach out with something esoteric or something I haven&#039;t mentioned. I pride myself on pleasing clients, and I am always happy to help with anything you are working on.","           15,288.25",16,              945.66,3,[UpworkerLink](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0152b9cbeac40ac08c)

&quot;Nadeem came in and revised the work of another editor who did not do such a great time and he did it in half the time. He also edited another online course which was very professionally done. His intro/outro segments were stellar and he created a little commercial that was very creative. I highly recommend him and will definitely be hiring him again (in fact I already have).&quot; Dr. Maiysha. US.

Quinn G.,Doylestown,Podcast Manager | Media Producer,"Hello UpWork, I‚Äôm Quinn. In my consulting business, I have launched 10 podcasts and produced over 150 podcast episodes (totaling over 900 hours of audio editing, sound design, and mixing among them). The best news? None of my clients are experiencing podfade.

What&#039;s podfade you might ask? It&#039;s when you&#039;re excited about your podcast, launch it, and then realize between recording, chasing after guests, editing, and not knowing the audio engineering to make it sound how you want...this thing is a full-time job. 

That&#039;s why you&#039;re reading this. I produce and manage podcasts, so you can focus on your job, your kids, or networking with new guests (or writing if you&#039;re a solocaster--yes you can do it alone!).  

Common pain points I help people with:

- How many episodes do I need to launch?
- Do I need an episode every week? 
- What mic do I get? (hint: it&#039;s not the blue yeti)
- Can I use Zoom to record my remote guest (yes...but do you instead want to represent your brand better if the tools existed--because they do!) 
- How do I get ADs? (it&#039;s complicated - but maybe you don&#039;t need them?)
- How much money can I make with my podcast?

When we start, I begin by listening to you. What do you need? What are you overwhelmed by in starting your project? Once we figure that out, I will create a custom production plan based on your needs. 

I coach you through the steps to make your podcast sustainable for you or your business. 

The clients I choose to work with are seeking something different, something more than average to serve the people they seek to reach. I help them achieve that.

If you want to create a podcast that thoughtfully serves the people in your audience or community, all I ask is that you are willing to learn along the way. If you think I might be a good fit for your project, please reach out to me I&#039;d be happy to schedule a free discovery call with you!

Elaine K.,Lexington,Podcast Editor and Voiceover Artist,"My goal is to help you clearly communicate your message, free of errors and distractions, so that all your listeners hear is a polished, professional recording!

-Content Editing
I listen to your content, keep the most important parts, and cut parts that are excessive or repetitive, so that your episodes fit into an allotted timeframe.  Not every editor is willing or has the ability to do this.

-Removing Mistakes
I edit your podcast episodes for conciseness (removing excessive &quot;um&#039;s,&quot; &quot;you knows,&quot; repetitive words, and foibles).  I splice words and sentences and put them back together again seamlessly so that your audience won&#039;t be able to tell you made a mistake.  I also take out long pauses to keep your conversation flowing smoothly.

-Noise Reduction &amp; Sound Improvement
I remove distracting background noise, hiss, pops, clicks, mic bumps, and loud breaths.  I also eliminate certain frequencies, like sirens and cell phone chirps. I reduce Zoom call artifacts and delays.  And I minimize echo to help live events sounds more like they were recorded in a regular room instead of on a stage.  

-Mixing &amp; Mastering
I mix your recording with your intro, outro, and sponsorship ads in the Adobe Audition multitrack editor.  I level out the volume of yours and your guests&#039; voices, and add equalization and compression for a broadcast quality sound. 

-Intro/Outro Creation and Sponsorship Ads
I am an American voice talent, with 35 &quot;five star&quot; ratings on Voices.com.  I have also recorded 11 audiobooks that are for sale on audible.com.  I can write and record your podcast intro and outro and choose music to make them stand out and get listener attention!

-Audiogram Creation
An audiogram is a short video representation of your podcast that you can share on social media!  You choose a clip from one of your episodes that you would like to share, and I will add captions, along with an animated waveform that you can post on your favorite sites! This is a great way to get your audience excited about your upcoming episodes!

-Podcast Cover Art
I can design podcast cover art that fits the vibe of your podcast that you can upload to iTunes to make your podcast stand out from the crowd!

I have a bachelor&#039;s degree in broadcasting, with a minor in English.

ABOUT
Tom has a background in television, feature films, emerging technologies, marketing, and business development.

In 1991, Tom discovered Northeastern&#039;s television studio while studying Communication at Northeastern University. Adding a concentration in television and film to his studies, Tom spent many days (and nights) mastering all the equipment in the studio.

Late in 1991, the studio installed an Avid Media Composer digital editing system, a brand new technology. Tom immediately saw it as the future and became proficient with the system. Over the next two years, Avid took the video world by storm.

Referred and championed by his Northeastern professor&#039;s Tom was hired by Reebok (freelance) to assist and train the in-house video department on the Avid editing system. Reebok was gearing up for the Super Bowl XXVI launch of the tragically flawed, &quot;Dan vs. Dave&quot; multi-million dollar advertising campaign. The campaign was designed to generate buzz between two American decathletes: Dan O&#039;Brien and Dave Johnson - for the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. Both were considered &quot;sure locks&quot; for gold and silver medals. The campaign took a tragic turn when Dan failed to qualify for the games. It was a great learning experience for a young college student. Tom also realized the corporate world was not for him.

In 1993, again referred by his professors, Tom was hired by an independent production company to apply his skills with the Avid Media Composer for a PBS documentary. By the time the documentary was finished Tom was also responsible for field sound recording and he composed the music for the production. The documentary - Sex Education In America: AIDS and Adolescence - received critical acclaim after a congressional viewing with the Surgeon General of the United States of America.

In 1994, Tom moved to Los Angeles to join a start-up Avid editing system provider for feature films. This was at the dawn of the digital editing era when Hollywood made the move from traditional film-based editing to digital editing. Tom spent countless hours in the cutting rooms (editing rooms) supporting the systems and working with many Academy Award-winning, producers, directors and editors. Some of the films Tom worked on include: As Good As It Gets, Jackie Brown, Mulholland Drive, Titanic and Waiting for Guffman.

Brian R.,Blaine,Video Production,"Hello!

I am a Video Editor and Audio Producer with 11+ years of experience in the field. I have completed projects for companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Tedx, Yelp, Spacex, and more. I have a wide range of experience spanning from video editing, graphic design, photography, live stage production and music production.

My communication skills are the reason I can deliver products that accomplish the message you are trying to convey. I make every project personal to me because at the end of the day, the only thing that matters is your message.

I work in a process that guides the both of us to your final product:

Outline:
We discuss the main idea of your project. We agree on the style and ‚Äúlook‚Äù you want to achieve. We review examples or similar projects that have elements you like. We review what elements need to be created and a timeline for an initial draft.

Draft:
I will organize a draft of the video, sound, music, photos, animations or titles that will encompass your main idea and the core elements that were discussed in the outline. This will serve as a storyboard for your ideas and can serve as a great point to re-evaluate your message and how you want it portrayed. 

First cut:
A high quality version of all elements put together that will closely resemble your final product. This will include high resolution renders of animations or titles. As well as sound mixing, music mixing and sound effects.

Mastering:
This is where the polishing begins with color correction and sound mastering. The final rendering of your product with all of the quality settings ‚Äúcranked up to 11‚Äù.

Delivery:
Multiple versions are rendered for different uses and any separate elements divided and rendered. 

I am always available for questions and discussions of anything you need. 100% customer satisfaction is my goal, and I am not happy until you are happy.","           80,917.28",2213,               36.56,15,[UpworkerLink](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01f67da1c5da71ce67)

This part isn&#039;t intended to bore you with how many years I have worked and how many big companies I have worked with because that&#039;s basically every video editor in here because what matters at the end of the day is this: when you bring your project to me and we discuss the best approach to take it, I&#039;ll get it done, on time, in line with YOUR goals of why you wanted to make the video in the first place.

That been said, I am a 23-year old professional video editor and an enthusiastic filmmaker, with 4+ years of experience. I specialize in making videos that hit with the message that YOU want to put forward to your potential viewers.

Feel free to drop a message and let me know your project details and we can discover the best approach to take it. Let&#039;s get the ball rolling!

Holger B.,Panglao,"German Translator/Proofreader &amp; Localization, German Voice Over Artist","**TOP RATED! ‚Ä®Less than 10% Upwork freelancers have this badge. 77 Five-Star Reviews!**

Hello, and thank you for visiting my Upwork profile, here is a quick outline of my skills and talents. I am a native German with near-native English proficiency and excellent written and verbal skills in both languages and 26 years of experience as an English to German translator/proofreader. I do quality and accurate translations of English Educational/IT/Marketing/E-Commerce and other material into German and deliver a quick turnaround. I have a keen sense of translation, Word choice, sentence structure, punctuation, grammar, etc. and my forte is to make sure that my translations sound like natural German. 

Currently I am translating a monthly Newsletter for Microsoft Corporation in Redmond, WA (since July 2020), and since May 2020 I am translating daily stock market news for the Spanish translation agency IPT-Translations.

**Voice-Over Recordings**
Aside from translations I also do voice-over recordings in studio quality for language audiobooks, sales &amp; &#039;How-To&#039; videos, IVR Phone recordings, kidz-apps, travel guides, explainer videos and YouTube tutorials, etc., in German and in English. I use the Samson Q1U Dynamic Microphone in a soundproofed environment (acoustic foam, studio set up). Likewise, I am also experienced in timing audios and syncing them to original videos and slideshows.

**Highlights of my History as a Linguist**
From June 2020 to May 2022 I translated video subtitles and captions for the American company Rev (rev.com), which amounted to 3500 minutes of video material and earnings of $10,200 for a total of 360 videos, using their in-house Atlas video editor. The majority were sales, marketing &amp; e-commerce videos, as well as product videos for corporations such as Yamaha, Fender, D&#039;Addario, Lumisoft, Hitachi, Canon, Amazon Music, Hines and Schenker. I also translated TEDx Talks and Ed Sullivan Shows featuring Louis Armstrong, Elvis Presley, Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes, Ella Fitzgerald and the Four Tops, which included translating the song lyrics.

From April 2017 to August 2019 I translated ca. 600 quizzes for Howstuffworks.com from English to German, the topics ranging from music, movies, the 80s, cars, how to fix cars, personality quizzes, math &amp; science quizzes, general knowledge, history, geography to many other subjects. Because my client&#039;s business needs changed, he ended the contract in August 2019.

From 2014 until 2017 I was focusing on doing voice-overs for many clients and companies from all over the world and was taking care of the translations part for some of them as well.

In 2013 I was busy working for the Marvel Comics Group via Language Connect, UK to translate comic book back issues (1968s - present) of Spider-Man, Avengers, X-Men, Iron Man, Thor and many other superheroes. 

From 1998 to 2012‚Ä® I was co-heading the English-German translations desk for the publishing companies Aurora Productions, CH and Activated Desk, UK, all the while working in an English speaking micro-environment. In this position my focus was on translations from the ground up, proofreading and quality control. I was also overseeing and training a group of remote translators and facilitated and proofread their work. The majority of the material has been on the topics of personal development, coaching &amp; training, and on religion &amp; spirituality. To further underscore my proficiency and language awareness: I hold a degree as a TEFL-Teacher (teaching English as a foreign language); I am a certified Life-Coach as well and coach clients in both languages.

Kris S.,Bangkok,"High Quality, Engaging Videos that Pop","Hey, I&#039;m Kris.

I&#039;m someone who knows about workflow and organizing everything well, so we can comb through the footage, audio, and titles until you&#039;re satisfied your message hits. We will take all the necessary steps to create a story that brings the viewer in and keeps them watching.    

I will take your footage and pop the image using modern color grading techniques with the best software available.  I will add motion graphics, titles, and transitions that highlight your message while pacing everything to make the viewer want to be a part of your mission.

A bonus I bring is my years of experience as a musician.  I have a degree in jazz performance, so improvisation is my rhythm.  Audio engineering was a significant part of my studies, so whether you provide audio or need additional VO or music, the sound will be as crisp and clean as your visuals.

Think of me as your very own nimble, affordable agency, cranking out one-of-a-kind content that truly captivates your audience. Need to add a little electricity to your YouTube channels and podcast feeds? Let‚Äôs talk.

With a background in theatre and immersive events, I‚Äôm all about telling stories that make people feel something. Your content needs to do more than just tick the SEO boxes, right? It needs pull people in, and entertain them in a way they can‚Äôt forget.

My expertise in brand stories, identities, and guidelines means I know how to study your brand and capture your voice. At the same time, because I‚Äôm a creative weirdo, I always add a fun twist. Whether it‚Äôs an explainer video hosted by a talking bottle, or social media posts from a globe-trotting mannequin, you won‚Äôt find anything boring around here.

If you‚Äôre wondering, yes: I use artificial intelligence and machine learning in my workflow. So when you work with me, you also get my team of cyborgs as a bonus. And it rocks. ChatGPT helps me conduct research and generate ideas, while Auphonic ensures that your podcast sounds pristine. This helps me supercharge the creative process, and move more quickly, at no extra cost to you. We live in the future, I guess.

With me, you&#039;ll get the benefits of a larger team, paired with the speed, clarity, and price tag of a single expert. Equipped with the latest tools and technologies, I‚Äôll make sure your brand stands out with your target audience, and sticks in their minds.

Keith H.,Brooklyn,NYC-Based Video Producer / Videographer / Editor / Animator,"Hands-on, tailored, cinematic video production -- on time, on message, on budget. When I founded my production company, ReelSmart Productions, a decade ago, this was the value I intended to bring to clients in a production market that is flooded with often unreliable and unaffordable options. And for over eight years, I have delivered on that mission for companies and nonprofit organizations worldwide. 

My videos have helped start-up companies and nonprofits secure major funding, boosted the market reach of established firms, and even played a role in expanding ferry service across New York City. 

I approach all of my projects with the mind of a marketer and communications professional, honing in on the unique features of a product, service, or mission and distilling them down into a message that is relatable, accessible, and compelling for the target audience. 

I thrive on creative problem solving and pride myself on my sharp eye for detail and my impeccable sense of style. And unlike many creative professionals, I also bring a diverse professional skill set to my work: including project management know-how from my years as a community organizer; the intellect of a trained economist; and the language skills of a professional writer whose work has appeared in a variety of publications from The Huffington Post to Scientific American.

Hi everyone! I&#039;m a professional video editor for more than 7 years. I like my job, no matter what this project is: a promo video, a YouTube video, a wedding video or a trailer for a game or a movie. 
Each project needs an individual approach. If this is a promo video or a video for YouTube, you need to know on what to focus the attention of the audience, what audience it is expecting for. The video should convey information that could interest after viewing. A wedding video or a video from a trip is always a whole story that needs to be shown correctly to evoke good emotions, pleasant experiences and memories. The trailer should intrigue and immerse the viewer in the atmosphere of what is happening. That is the principles that I manage in my work!


My skills:

- 8k, 4k video
- videos for a real estate listing, drone videos
- promo videos, trailers, slideshows
- wedding videos (full film, highlight film and short clip)

- motion graphics
- captions, titles

From my advantages I can list: creativity, optimism, seriousness in approach to work, responsibility to terms, I always try to do everything as qualitatively as possible.

p.s. when it comes to videography, every project is unique and requires a different amount of time and resources to complete. Hourly rates can be a useful tool in some industries, but in the world of videography, they do not always accurately reflect the value of the work being done. Instead, I prefer to work on a project basis. This means that we will agree on a total fee for the project based on its scope and requirements. This allows me to dedicate the necessary time and attention to every aspect of the project and deliver high-quality results without worrying about time constraints.

Hi, I‚Äôm Gon√ßalo, a videographer and video editor based in Lisbon, Portugal, with 10+ year experience.

My services can include up to the 3 levels of video production - planning, shooting and editing - and go from creating the necessary videos to implement a video strategy for your company all the way to editing YouTube videos of footage you have had on your archives for many years, and everything in between. I have shot and edited promotional and explainer videos, testimonials and interviews, YouTube vlogs, online courses, concerts, weddings, corporate events, short fiction films and documentaries.

Having studied filmmaking and worked in the film and TV industry has made me a results oriented creative. Getting a video made for you or your company does not have to be difficult, and you can actually go from pre-production to final delivery rather quickly and efficiently. Whether you need a promotional video for Youtube, a video ad for Facebook, or an Instagram reel in 9:16, I will send you the finished product ready to be posted on any platform of your choosing.

Thomas Anthony F.,Oradell,"Video Producer, Director, Editor, VFX, Motion Graphics","I have over 15 years professional video production experience.  I can handle everything from pre-production to post production, which includes high level visual effects and motion graphics ability, color correction/grading, noise reduction, and much more.  I have a lot of experience serving as the only crew on small productions, so I&#039;m very comfortable with wearing multiple, or all hats if need-be.

I got my start before the modern age of technology, shooting on both film and tape, and editing on tape decks as well as literally cutting film on a Steenbeck.

I work with the Adobe Creative Suite and can do anything you need, from simple b-roll editing, ads for broadcast, OTT, and socials.  If you need motion graphics, animated logos, or other design needs, I have you covered. 

I believe in clear communication and goal setting at the beginning of a project and aiming high. My goal is to help you realize your vision with a product that makes you proud and helps you accomplish your goals.

My skill sets include:

- Video Editing.   I have edited everything from commercials and marketing promos to sizzle reels and program length projects. Recent freelance projects include a sizzle reel for Mom Hint by Sherri French, explainer videos for Solutions Journalism Network, and commercials for clients like Koala Insulation.

- Graphics.   I am very comfortable creating graphics for any platform. I create the graphics for all my productions, from basic text on the screen to motion graphics and animation.

- Executive Producer.  My background as a showrunner began with co-creating the live daily lifestyle show Today in Nashville for WSMV-TV. I built the show from the ground up, leading set design and installation, building the team, casting the hosts, overseeing graphic design, and promoting the show on the air and social platforms. I also worked with WSMV&#039;s parent company, The Meredith Corporation, to launch The Southern Living Show. The program featured the best of Southern Living&#039;s content and was broadcast across the United States.

- Marketing.  I worked for several years as a Creative Services Director. In that role, I gained experience as a media buyer and developed marketing strategies for my station and the station&#039;s clients. That experience has helped improve my skills as both a producer and editor. I look at everything with an eye on the ultimate goal of the project.

Laura M.,Columbus,Artisanal animation for visual storytellers,"&quot;Laura combines technical skill and know-how with a keen sense of storytelling, why we chose her to begin with, and now, quite thankful we did!&quot;

We all have stories to tell.

Maybe one story has germinated in your mind for weeks, months, or even years.

It makes you feel thrilled and passionate. You jot down ideas when they strike, you work out how a character would act in a certain situation, you absorb all the world-building advice you can, and your browser boasts a suspiciously sordid search history (you swear it&#039;s all just research).

Now you&#039;ve written that script, you&#039;ve polished that final draft of your book, and/or you&#039;ve consistently updated that web comic for months. Great job!

But after jumping the hurdles of creation (and admittedly stumbling over some of them), you want more eyes on your work. Wouldn&#039;t it be awesome to get potential customers as hyped about your story as you are?

Here&#039;s where hand-drawn animation comes in.

Everyone&#039;s seen one of those corporate explainer videos with floaty, sterile-looking motion graphics. They&#039;re fine for getting facts and simple concepts across, but they rarely- if ever- evoke a visceral reaction in anyone watching them.

There&#039;s no &quot;wow&quot; factor.

On the flip side, more hands-on 2D animation methods require characters to be authentic with their emotions, allowing viewers to feel a strong connection with them.

Traditional animation has a soulful, hand-crafted look that can be tailored to fit your story and your audience. No generic assets here!

Finally, a fluid, clean, emotional animation drawn frame by frame will show fans you care about craftsmanship. Just as the greatest animators have elevated the medium to the level of fine art, you&#039;ve elevated your ideas to their own place of honor.

Your audience will be excited to see their favorite characters jump to life on screen, even more vividly than you brought them to life in their heads. Then there will be newcomers intrigued by the action taking place.

Old friends and fresh faces alike will all want to see more.

If this seems like fantasy to you, hit the green button or the white button, and I&#039;ll meet you in the professor&#039;s old wardrobe. ","           88,392.74",1623,               54.43,30,[UpworkerLink](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01dc98a2adbd08a43b)

I also apply the same thinking to Motion Graphics work produced in After Effects and often combines this animation with video movie footage to create new and compelling video products.
